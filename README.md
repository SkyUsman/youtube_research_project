## Tasks
- Continue filtering a bit more (add some more constraints).
- Combine all of our filtered output CSVâ€™s into one folder (different files).
- Have the survey randomly pull - say 10 - comments from each CSV.
- Ensure we add a counter to track the output.
- Make sure the results actually update. Say we run the script and complete the survey, for the next run, it should grab comments randomly and ones that have no counter or so.
