Comment: Why are the comments berating the sketch . It‚Äôs not funny tbh but did it hurt ppl so much to just wear masks ? Logically to prevent respiratory infections wearing a mask would definitely help and should be a general practice each flu season ‚Ä¶ even if it did not statistically make a difference was it such a hassle to be so angry about it even years later

Comment: I love how snl waited 2 years to address the doubts after demonizing people for being hesitant. 
Also: astrazeneca just withdrew their vax from the globalist distribution cause they've been proven to cause blood clots. So yeah, all these "dirty,stupid and selfish" anti vaxers were totally right.

Comment: What's so funny?

It's 2024 and people still wear masks.

Outside. 

Walking by themselves. No one within 50 feet of them.

And it's warm.

Maybe, and this is just a theory,  they're ugly and have funky breath and are trying to protect us from all that.

Good for them.

And dude that never washed his hands. Guys never washed their hands. They could have taken a hot poop. Not a drop of water shall touch their hands!üòÇ

Comment: This is so like real life. I've gone to many wedding receptions and been at a table w people I've never met. Everyone has a couple of drinks...fun, casual convo, and someone will inevitably bring up a controversial topic that two of the people disagree on. That's when to excuse yourself to use the restroom, stand in the hallway for 15 minutes, then go sit at the bar by yourself.

Reply: As an introvert, I kinda enjoyed the 2019 plague!

People didn't run into my leg with their carts.

The streets were cleaner.

I didn't almost get ran over by a car.

People went to the stores alone vs with the whole extended family. 

I was able to go to those stores, get what I wanted and got out without squeezing between shopping carts.

I took the train and no one's crotch was in my face. I definitely didn't miss the usual Chicago rush hour. Bleh! Trains were cleaner and way much quieter. And on time!!!

I was in a northern Chicago burb, but felt like I lived in the sticks. It was so nice for a while!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Comment: instead of vaccinating and mask wearing what would have stopped it would be: everyone gets a months worth of food & water, then isolate everyone somewhere. put all services on cruise control. stop all airplane flights, stop all deliveries. no cars or trucks driving, etc. a total lockdown of everyone and everything. the virus would burn itself out within a month because it could not spread. then release everyone back to the wild so to speak and resume life as normal.

Comment: While it's true that wearing a mask does actually hinder the spread of the virus in a general sense, people act like it magically shielded you from COVID and the moment you take it off you automatically give COVID to everyone within a 1 mile radius.

Comment: The last thing I read from The New York Times was that ‚Äúeveryone now has Covid.‚Äù I don‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt think normalizing a disease with a barely researched etiology makes any sense. It is inside people‚Äôs bodies and it is not known well at all what it will do over time. There were over 90+ mutations found incubating in some drug addict‚Äôs compromised immune system. It does not go away. It can always be detected in a carrier. And it can infect anyone near the carrier during its contagious period. Trump was the first person i saw to rip off his mask so defiantly, as he said drinking bleach would cure it, so I think he deserves the lion's share of blame. Every political event in that time had a Covid infection tally. They all gathered together, coughing and laughing all over each other, and now they‚Äôre infected, probably wondering how many years their lives will be shortened.

Comment: I like SNL.  I like science.  I got every childhood vax, shingles vax, annual flu vax.  And I will get the RSV vax.  Why?  They actually did good science on them.

I have gotten zero covid boosters.  Why?  Find one double-blind-placebo test on them.  Oh, you can't?  right because they never did any.  You can't say "believe the science" when you didn't do any, lefties.

Comment: I know one thing. While the masks were mandated, I never once got a cold or a flu. Soon as they came off, I started getting sick again. 

But yes, some situations were absolutely ridiculous and were not handled properly (like the whole having to wear a mask while entering a restaurant but then you take it off at your table situation). And that's largely because food service workers, supermarket workers, movie theater workers etc., are not medical staff and didn't themselves know what to do or not do. And of course, getting politics into it didn't help, either.

Mostly sad for them and angry at my country's absolute failure to do anything about those idiots (or about anything actually) but as someone with chronic illness who did literally anything possible to make sure I make it out alive (I caught it acter my third dose and I ended up in hospital. Without the vaccines I'd be dead) while idiots did nothing and were sneezing and coughing without even closing their mouths in public transportation and then yelling at anyone who said something - a little glad too. Not proud of it but well...

Comment: Faucci, CDC, and the medical industry spoke with an authority what they said was "science" when it was in reality speculation.  Basically, they lied (wasn't science but speculation) and in the end were proven wrong in almost every regard:  WAS a lab leak, lockdowns had NO MATERIAL IMPACT on long-term spread, masks had no MEASURABLE impact, and the vaccine was safe for EVERYONE.  Imagine the diseases we could have cured or mouths we could have fed with the $10 Trillion.  Biggest scam ever.

Comment: "When an anti-vaxer gets it, I feel happy" - Hahaha, that's funny because I kind of feel the same way when a 'In this house we believe in science' pincushion gets it over and over again. Well, not happy, but at least hopeful that the wheels in their head will start spinning a bit.

Comment: You see, Covid is the world first Smart Virus. Unlike your standard virus that's not SMART, covid has likes & dislikes. For example covid loves small business, places of worship and it prefers to stay at least 5 feet above teh ground thus teh reason for closing all stores except for the large box box and big chains and why you have to mask until you sit down and are no longer at that 5 foot level where covid plays. 

#SARCASM - This shouldn't be necessary in a sane world but b/c we don't live in a sane world and thus there are those who actually believe this non-sense I have to place this tag as a reminder that it's sarcasm.

Comment: Gotta be honest, in three years I never thought once I would get it, or my house hold of three including me. We did all the right things to take extra prcauctions and we got it in Oct. Even with the vacc's it was not a pleasant experience especially when you have underlying issues. I'm still feeling exsuated but must keep going. And now my sister, husband and my twin nieces got it yesterday. So my message is, this thing ain't over. I now except and truly believe that everyone will eventually get it. I know it's your body and it's your choice whether to get get vaccinated or not, but just plz protect others especially the elderly.

Reply: you know you can tell them that company policy forbids it and they can go with another company (they want the couch). Or say "Masking is no longer required. here it is. I will bring it inside like this, or it can stay here on your sidewalk

Comment: Ahhh SNL, the late night comedy skit show that for 2 years made fun of the very ideas that are being said here, further adding to the hatred and division of ppl and reinforcing to "COMPLY!!!"
Oh wait, now its trendy to be skeptical, ok, change of plans!

Comment: The sheer idiocy and lack of common sense displayed by almost half the country over the last 2 years has been nothing short of mind-blowing. Had you told me that you could turn a large portion of Americans into such complete sheeple with so amazingly few verifiable facts and evidence based guidance from our "government" 20 years ago I would have laughed in your face as Americans have traditionally prided themselves on independence, know-how and common sense. Now I find myself literally amazed at how compliant and trusting people really have become despite volumes of actual scientific evidence that make it abundantly clear that the elected officials in this country have no desire to protect you, are largely beholden to the special interest groups, big pharma and lobbyist and have no problems sacrificing your freedoms, your rights and even your lives if it keeps them in power and brings them more wealth. WAKE UP!

Comment: Well, let's be real though. We learned a lot, we took a lot of precautions that maybe were unnecessary, but at the end of the day, indoor parties and restaurants and bars and indoor religious gatherings were the main spreaders of COVID, and half the people in the US took the adequate sacrifices and self-isolated, vaccinated themselves, wore masks, everything they could on their part to shorten the pandemic.... aaaand the other half who were just like "fuck it", and partied like there was no tomorrow, filled up the hospitals, refused to vaccinate, died like flies, and dragged this shitshow out for 2 bloody boring years. 

If I had to do the pandemic over, I'd be way more lax about meeting people outdoor in small groups, but I'd still clean everything thoroughly, vaccinate, and avoid crowded indoor spaces. I'd pretty much do the same thing, since I never got COVID, so it worked. And I even traveled by plane A LOT (almost once a month) these last 2 years. Hygiene and fresh air or properly conditioned/filtered air were the key ingredients, plus the vaccine.

Reply: And an addendum: the people who masked up were the people who took all the other precautions and avoided COVID, so masking up was one piece of a greater whole. People who did not mask up did other stupid things as well and got COVID. It's one detail of a bigger picture, where all the little details added up.

Reply: @@richmellow3315 Yes! But that's not SNL's fault. People are blaming them when YouTube/and the media networks made the rules ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è which they blame on what their advertisers and investors wanted. The frustration is just in the wrong place.

Edit: Also, something I think we can all agree on is that the general public can be quite ignorant. It sucks that certain government officials think that they know all but it's just human nature to take a mile when given an inch. You tell people they don't need a mask outside, and suddenly the super spreader nightclub is open (or it never closed depending on where you're at). It's just what happens and they wanted to avoid that as research continued. Think about the "security theater" at airports.

Comment: Some of us were saying this for almost two years. It‚Äôs nice to know that things have evolved and people are allowed to admit they were wrong.  The best thing you can do if you‚Äôve been against forced innoculation is be kind when those opposing you apologize (if they do). We need more prominent folks out there standing up because no one listens to the little guy. Thank you Dr. Jay Bhattacharia and Dr. Vinay Prasad, as well as  Dr. John Ioannidis. If the only scientists you know are Walensky and Fauci, you should check out the above. They represent science, not ‚ÄúThe Science‚Äù TM.

Comment: It's time like these I wonder if people realize some of us had been wearing masks since before COVID (I mean I didn't). They do help protect against getting infected and really help if you have bad allergies, but they aren't a one solve all (I don't know where that perception comes from). If you eat at a party or go to a nightclub the mask isn't going to help. At that point they're just used as excuses to justify. Also the mask mandate wasn't to protect against infection, it was to stop the spread. So if you had covid and went out shopping not knowing that, no one else got infected. Which is again why it made no sense for the mask to be mandated in the highest risk places (where everyone was already risking covid). It seemed like no one (including the gov't) had no idea what was going on with the masks which created a lot of frustration from all sides 

At the end of the day, I liked the masks. I found them to be useful for cold weather and more importantly my health as I usually get sick once a year (not during masks however), but I didn't wear one to a nightclub. That's just silly. I'm already 100% getting something. A mask isn't stopping that.

Comment: First off, this isn't even funny. They do a lousy job with humor. Second, if you think this skit over for just a bit, it becomes apparent that it's nothing more than a blatant attempt at manipulation and saving the liberal vote in the mid-term elections. They're backpedaling and trying to appease the vast number of disillusioned Americans and trying to make it look like it's somehow all a joke. Or if not a joke, at least a well intentioned mistake. I think that this was their line, "We did our best." Bullcrap! The truth couldn't be further from this. To huge numbers of people who lost their jobs and their friends and their sense of safety, it was neither a joke nor a mistake, nor was it our government "doing its best" for us. It was a designed approach to take away our liberties and lets face it, it's been working! Don't be fooled by this joke of an SNL skit as they try desperately to save themselves. That's what's really laughable.

Comment: although sometimes it was pointless wearing a mask, i loved it. keeps your face warm in the winter and I haven't gotten sick in over 2 years- no flu, no seasonal allergies, and it's so easy to ignore people on the streets if you just don't feel like it. maybe it's not meant for everyone but there were benefits to it. there were people overreacting on both sides as usual so just move on.

Reply: @John Jon You could be immune. I never wore a mask for like 2.5 years unless forced to and I never got Covid. Some people just seem to have a natural, innate, immunity. And if masks worked, we wouldn't be in this mess still. Same could be said for the vaccines. So like, you're wrong.

Reply: My favorite masksituation was *not* eating in restaurants at all - indoors or out - and wearing an n-95 whenever I was forced to be indoors with others (in taxis, on the subway, & at doctors' offices)... I work from home so masking at work isn't an issue.  And yes, it made a difference. I successfully avoided Covid until my spouse brought it home from work, after an unmasked moron came into his private office & infected him... & he infected me.  Luckily, we are fully vaxed & boosted AND I'm in NYC, where it's a snap to get treatment (pills or monoclonal antibodies... we have plenty, while my friends in some other states were told they couldn't get treated & they had to suffer through more than a week of coughing, exhaustion & body aches).

Reply: The victims are all those that died unnecessarily to Covid when effective medicines existed. The people that were told to "come back when you can't breathe" and were subsequently left to die with improper treatment. Thousands of them. The "anti" people you speak of, like me, we're fine. We just watched you inject yourselves with mystery syrup and clap like a seal for anyone else who did. We're chillin'.

Sure, we won't remember that Hollywood, big corporations, and government were all pushing absurdities to and including the vaccine. This stupid skit still tries to pretend the vaccines are absolutely safe and there have been no ill side-effects. Disgusting.

Sure there are still cased but same goes for stuff like the flu. There's going to be a new strain every year just like the flu and it's going to stay the cat is out of the bag. But we have being given a Fighting chance and we can't keep walking around like plague doctors living in fear. Gotta rip the bandaid off at some point.

Comment: Were the mask mandates kinda pointless? Yeah. Am I anti-mask? No. Some people in this comment section think this is an anti-mask skit, but it's not. It's poking fun at how the government's rules weren't strict enough to be helpful, but present enough to effect us. It is not a justification to make people pity you for being anti-mask.

Reply: MSM literally demonized Belarus for being the only country that didn't impose anything, no lockdowns, quarantines, online classes, no masks, no mandatory vaccination, the citizens were even advised not to get vaccinated and to spend more time outdoors, working in fields, playing hokey...they were right all this time.

Comment: I really don't find this to be a laughing matter at all. People died alone in these hospitals because of the craziness of their idiotic rules. They went way over board. The vaccination has caused havoc on so many people. Why? Because it was the worst thing one could ever have chosen to do. My mom is in the hospital right now with blood clots in her lungs. Why? Because she was vaccinated! I am livid right now. The doctors will never tell her that. I know thats what its from. My mom is healthy for her age. She has never had medical issues her entire life and now she has blood clots? Yeah, ok!! Its from that dam vaccine and there isn't a dam thing I can do about it. My sister is also vaccinated. They wouldn't listen to me. This is in no way funny.

Comment: I live in NYC and this one enrages me. I lost nearly all my "friends" of many years who lost their minds over this and are completely irrational and panic striken over this. I had to hire an attorney and spent a couple of months writing my exemption statement because I did not feel the juice was a smart decision for me. The nonstop fear porn and people acting like massive authoritarian jerks wishing ill on anyone who didn't do as commanded by our corrupt government  has been the most unfunny thing I've ever lived through.

Reply: Your anger is legitimate and the pain is real. We're not just "going back to normal" and pretending this never happened. It was the biggest psychological experiment ever and boy did the elites learn how many zombies there are. Sad to say, so did the rest of us and we learned that all the people that we thought were so "nice" in reality weren't nice at all but could've lived back in Hitler's time and saluted him as he walked down the street. Scary.

Comment: Yes, well, no, not funny, so not brave of you to say these things now. You should have many months ago, if not sooner. I just re-watched SNL from first few years, and you children do not even come close to parity of their raw talent, bravery, biting satire and innovation they had. A lot of people need to apologize to a lot of people, and anyone wearing a mask outside, or driving by yourself, guess what? You have a mental problem. You can keep wearing it so I know who you are.

Comment: I can make this real simple. 
There is no giant ON/OFF switch for anything. Nothing is 100% effective, just like birth control,  but everything helps a little. 
Wearing a mask sometimes helps a little. Social distancing helps a little. If you are at high risk, or if you come onto contact with people that you care about who are high risk, or if you generally care about everyone, doing the little bit that you can, when you can, helps a little.

Reply: @@golfer5990 if that is how you choose to apply the information I provided that is up to you. All I did was state the facts, which are that masks won't give you eternal life and they aren't completely useless. 
Most people start their decision making from a place of exaggeration in their preferred direction. Then they exaggerate the position of a perceived opponent to make their rational viewpoint appear ridiculous. For example, if someone said masks provide some protection and they reply that 'based on your logic, everyone across the US should drive at a snail's pace on the highway.' See "False equivalence" and also "Strawman". 
Or alternatively, you could stand by your beliefs and actually argue against the point I made, instead of using logical fallacies. You could try to prove that masks have no effect whatsoever, or you could agree with me that masks actually do have some effect but that you feel that it should be a person‚Äôs choice instead of a mandate. 
In other words, we could have a rational discussion as adults and find common ground, learning to use cooperation and compromise to move forward together. That's how we used to do things in this country, before we were encouraged to fight each other. Just a suggestion.

Reply: ‚Äã@@ThyKingdomCome_7 It was a simple strawman attack, easily taken apart. Not terribly great, but more importantly that kind of attack discourages an intelligent discussion and keeps us fighting with each other instead of working together against our common enemy. 
A great rebuttal would have been documented proof that masks, vaccines and distancing are 0% effective. Another great rebuttal would have been if he agreed that those things can be effective but it should still be a person's choice and not a mandate. Another great rebuttal would have been if he agreed that those things can be effective but authorities are acting as if they will stop every illness, every time, and ‚Äúa woman called me a baby killer because I lowered my mask to drink my soda on the plane.‚Äù 
All he did was apply a logical fallacy common to internet debates and popularized as a legitimate debate strategy by the media. A debate strategy that does anything other than address the actual topic being discussed is just destructive and encourages argument instead of communication. Why would anyone want the American public to behave like that? What possible motive could they have?

In the spring of 2020 I was terrified & hoped for a vx. Bare with me here. I was running myself ragged: wiping & cleaning surfaces etc. The catalyst to my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù was an incident involving a beloved family mbr. who i refused entry to my home b/c he was running a temp & sent home to quarantine. At that point I set out to find out everything I possibly could about this ‚Äúpandemic!‚Äù 

With prayer & guidance I decided to look at all possible sides including unpopular opinions. The avenues & doors that opened to me was baffling in how it/information all came to fruition. What I initially noticed was the censorship in high gear & the silenced voices in the scientific community. Science doesn‚Äôt operate that way. This much I knew. 

I can‚Äôt get into everything (lengthy) but I can tell you this‚Ä¶we‚Äôve been lied to about many things involving this pandemic & we have captured govt agencies. You are definitely aware about the division component & thats all by design. 

The very thing ‚Äúthey‚Äù fear is unity! I appreciate you pointing that (about division )out. This is a message worth sharing!!

There has to be a middle ground between dipping yourself in latex before going outside and coughing a loogie in grandma's face.

This is one of the ways we take our country back, by refusing to take the bait and encouraging people into intelligent discussion online, instead of all the divisive name calling. Compromise used to be one of our tools, but now it's become a code word for failure.

A mask allows you to breath out and you are not fully inhaling what you just exhaled.  And even without a mask you can inhale some of what you exhaled.

Reply: TheManiac Gaming First no one else can still see your post, perhaps you edited it and only you can see it because it is shadow banned but others cannot.  I did get an email of your response so I will address what you original out.

‚Äúdude...‚Äù. Not very observant, I‚Äôm not a dude.  So strike one for you.

‚ÄúFirst reply, word for word... "May do that is to trigger people like you"‚Äù this doesn‚Äôt show anything.  The person said I was ‚Äúsaying childish things like ‚Äúhaha you‚Äôre so triggered!!!‚Äù‚Äù  Note how your quote of me doesn‚Äôt say that, not really even close.  I said triggering someone may be a possibility, that‚Äôs not even accusatory let alone emotional with ‚Äúhaha‚Äù and exclamation points and an accusation.  So nothing that the person put in quotes is accurate.

Now I did go on and say the original comment shows that it ‚Äúappears‚Äù to have worked.  Again this is not a definitive accusation as I said it‚Äôs a possibility with the use of the word appears, so I never claim they were triggered definitively and I never said ‚Äúhaha‚Äù or anything remotely emotional, I simply pointed to the evidence and a possibility.  So the prior person did lie.

Let me preface this by saying that I personally agree with how wearing masks doesn't hurt you or anything. So I'm not arguing against that. Actually I'm not really trying to get in an argument at all.


1. I agree. These are not full paragraphs. But spending the time to make these responses is not worth it. Almost nobody changes their mind in an argument in a YouTube comment section. Just do yourself a favor, and don't get in an argument on the internet. Actually, I just realized I just did the same thing I said not to do. Well, if you make a response, I'm only gonna reply with 1-3 sentences.

2. You didn't say that word for word, but in your first reply, you mentioned how the driver may or may not be trying to trigger Tina by wearing a mask. So he was more or less just slightly exaggerating what you said. The point is, this argument is not very civil. You didn't just go after masks, you went after their character.

3. I mean, until I looked it up, I thought "bud" was gender neutral because it's short for "buddy" which just means friend. And anybody can be your friend. Apparently it's not, but regardless, it's not the worst thing someone can call you, so maybe stick to the main topic.

Anyways, I probably have thought about this argument more than is healthy, so I hope you have a good day!

Reply: @@ManiacOfYouTube  ‚ÄúLet me preface this by saying that I personally agree with how wearing masks doesn't hurt you or anything. So I'm not arguing against that.‚Äù  You seem to want to say you aren‚Äôt arguing or not to argue.  There is a Shakespearean era quote (maybe actually Shakespeare) that says ‚Äúthou doth protest too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually I'm not really trying to get in an argument at all.‚Äù  Based on your initial attempt to try to support the other persons lie, this is a bit doubtful.
‚Äú1. I agree. These are not full paragraphs.‚Äù  Fine.

‚ÄúBut spending the time to make these responses is not worth it. Almost nobody changes their mind in an argument in a YouTube comment section.‚Äù  There is where you commit a strawman.  You think my position is that I want people to change their minds, I don‚Äôt as a primary goal.  I want to see biased peoples reaction when presented with consistent, evidence based and logical thinking.  I also want to educate them on what that type of thinking looks like.  Now if they change their mind fine, but most personalities that I encounter do not have the strength of self esteem to acknowledge their mind was changed publicly.

‚ÄúJust do yourself a favor, and don't get in an argument on the internet. Actually, I just realized I just did the same thing I said not to do. Well, if you make a response, I'm only gonna reply with 1-3 sentences.‚Äù  This is a very weak statement by you.  You are trying to tell me to not do something that you acknowledge you are doing which is weak.  It is still based on your faulty strawman of my goal.  And you try to limit my response by saying you will only respond with 1-3 sentences.  I respond fully and don‚Äôt set some arbitrary limit because I want to listen and show I listened to your words.

‚Äú2. You didn't say that word for word, but in your first reply, you mentioned how the driver may or may not be trying to trigger Tina by wearing a mask. So he was more or less just slightly exaggerating what you said.‚Äù  Nice continued lie by you.  I was able to point out that I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhaha‚Äù and you cannot refute this.  I was able to point out that I didn‚Äôt call the person triggered definitively, you cannot refute this.  And so there is nothing left of the lie that the other person told about what they claimed I said, those were the two parts and neither were true.  That‚Äôs not a slight exaggeration as you claim but way to grasp at straws by you.

‚ÄúThe point is, this argument is not very civil. You didn't just go after masks, you went after their character.‚Äù  You have no evidence of this.  I didn‚Äôt even say they were definitively triggered, I said it was a possibility of what the driver was going for and a possibility that it worked.  That‚Äôs a possibility of a possibility, and you act like I said something accusatory which the evidence shows I didn‚Äôt.  Now you lying about what I said and the other person lying about what I said, now that is uncivil but I‚Äôm not going to make a big deal about it.  It‚Äôs expected that others will respond to evidence that way.

‚Äú3. I mean, until I looked it up, I thought "bud" was gender neutral because it's short for "buddy" which just means friend. And anybody can be your friend. Apparently it's not, but regardless, it's not the worst thing someone can call you, so maybe stick to the main topic.‚Äù  Nice trying to excuse your faulty language.  First I didn‚Äôt bring up ‚Äúbud‚Äù or ‚Äúdude‚Äù you and the other person did.  So it is the two of you who didn‚Äôt stick to the main topic if that‚Äôs what you want to call it.  Second I didn‚Äôt act negatively just pointed out a fact that you referenced me wrong as did the other person.  Third you saw in my response to the other person that I was a woman yet insisted on still referencing me as a man, which is a bit hateful but again, I simply pointed out your error and did not make a big deal about it.  You are the only one who made a big deal about it.

‚ÄúAnyways, I probably have thought about this argument more than is healthy, so I hope you have a good day‚Äù I consistently have good days but you don‚Äôt honestly care about that, you just want to act like you took a higher ground but you lying, strawmanning, avoiding, projecting, etc. are not high road tactics but tactics you used.

Comment: The idea of people losing there jobs or losing money is horrible, but that is not an issue with a lockdown it's an issue with the overall system, it should not be possible to lose your job or get kicked out of your house or lose money during a pandemic, if that is a concern it means things have got to change. There was never an overreaction to Covid, really, the fact we are not on lockdown right now or that people are acting like the pandemic is not still going on shows that were underreacting to a dangerous degree.

Reply: Stop it. You're making too much sense, lol. Seriously though, I agree - I get the jokes but this sketch needed to pull back more in scope, because I think the bigger picture needs satirizing more than ever. 960,000+ Americans dead in a span of 2 years...and the ones so determined to be anti-vax and anti-mask were the ones who claim to "love America" the most, waving flags, watching Fox, voting Republican, as their families died, as their neighbors died, as Americans died by the hundreds of thousands, as they themselves died, they did nothing. Did SNL miss the irony or something?....I guess if I want relevant ironic twists from now on I'll have to watch the Twilight Zone...It's not ha-ha funny but it at least shows willfully ignorant people getting their comeuppance. And that's always fun, lol

The other side extreme is that masks did no good.

Third you already indirectly agreed it was extreme, by calling out all the things that weren‚Äôt going to work on the favor of one side and the other.  Forth you below calling it hyperbole is acknowledging it is extreme as hyperbole is extreme exaggeration.  

‚ÄúI just treat those types of claims as hyperbole‚Äù then per your logic, everything said about COVID was simply hyperbole and there were no extremes on either side.  Your logic is that everyone politicians and their followers only have hyperbole but not extreme views.  I know your logic doesn‚Äôt work but you are desperate so it brings you to this point.

Reply: @@Mike-sp7zv ‚ÄúI was hoping you were going to list at least one specific quote when I asked you repeatedly to list your extremes.‚Äù  Not a plausible story from you.  First I gave you the extremes when you asked so if you needed more detail or questioned one or more of them you should and would have asked then not ten or so posts later.  Second your request for me to list extremes was to list extremes not provide quotes, so you didn‚Äôt even ask for what now you claim you hoped for.  Third you agreed with at there were these statements (you tried to avoid calling then extremes but you still agreed there were these statements.)

I also note how you have completely avoided my other two examples - including one that even you said qualified for both sides.

Reply: @@tjones5719 any time you hear yourself saying that I agree with you, and you found yourself wondering why it sounded like I agreed with you when I laid out my thoughts on how the COVID response was handled, it could be, possibly, that I was giving my honest thoughts and that you're being overly defensive.  Perhaps I wanted you to elaborate on what you thought were extremes because I didn't find some to be extreme, which means that just because you did write something out, doesn't necessarily mean I would just know...we obviously had a misunderstanding at the beginning, and all I wanted was for you to elaborate for communication sake.

You know what I have supporting that I wasn‚Äôt defensive‚Ä¶ evidence.  Evidence like my responding right away and directly to your question about what were the extremes on both sides made funny by the skit.  This is no more than a projection of your flaw.  You using logical fallacies is defensive like your strawmen and red herrings and moving the goal posts.  You lying saying you aren‚Äôt trying to disagree but then in the same post you go out of your way to disagree.  These are evidence of your defensiveness.

‚ÄúPerhaps I wanted you to elaborate on what you thought were extremes because I didn't find some to be extreme‚Äù and this is more evidence that you wanted to disagree.  How do we know that‚Ä¶you just admitted you were feeling some of the items I was about to (yes, about to) reference were not extreme.  You painted yourself into a corner and you had to disagree with my list.  And that‚Äôs why you got so desperate to call something hyperbole but insist that an exaggerated statement or position is not extreme.  That was not your finest moment.

‚Äúwhich means that just because you did write something out, doesn't necessarily mean I would just know.‚Äù  You would just know what?  Now you unfortunately did not complete your thought so please restate if this was important.

‚Äúwe obviously had a misunderstanding at the beginning‚Äù. Again a projection by you.  I had no misunderstanding and your failure to point to any misunderstanding says you have no evidence of such.  You using strawmen is your misunderstanding.  You insisting that my statement must have extremes that you wouldn‚Äôt agree are extremes is a path toward your confirmation bias.

‚Äú‚Ä¶and all I wanted was for you to elaborate for communication sake.‚Äù  Nice lie.  You kept not responding to what I said.  You kept using logical fallacies.  You even lied.  Those are not signs you wanted to honestly communicate.

‚ÄúAnd about the part where you said that I should ask for more details that then, that's because of the misunderstanding‚Äù I laid out what the extreme items were.  You denied that I had insisting that I list them.  Then when push came to shove all of a sudden you could pick out the extreme items I listed.  That‚Äôs not misunderstanding that‚Äôs you wanting to avoid.

‚Äúalso, I'm asking now so there you go‚Äù. You have retreated.  You thought you could just ignore the extremes I listed, that didn‚Äôt work.  Your next approach was try to cherry pick only one and then move the goal posts of what I said, that didn‚Äôt work.  Then you tried to manipulate language and history but suggesting promises didn‚Äôt become policies and suggesting hyperbole is not an extreme though its definition indicates otherwise, that didn‚Äôt work.  And now only after those tactics have you now claimed that you don‚Äôt believe trump or Biden and their followers said anything about the right way this virus should have been handled and all would have been better except you never suggested this at all in your prior posts.  You see this isn‚Äôt a case where you just happened to delay asking the question, this is a tactic in a long line of tactics you have tried to avoid.

Reply: @@Mike-sp7zv ‚Äúwhen all you care about is semantics and technicalities‚Äù. Yet you can point to no semantics and no technicalities.  You cannot state a single definitive fault with anything I have said through all your posts.  So that makes this claim of yourself baseless.

‚Äúyou're just making your own head spin‚Äù nice projection of your own flaw.  You using logical fallacies causes your head to spin because you get caught up in the fallacies.  You avoiding a direct answer to your question when originally posed is your spinning with your avoidance.  Not one bit of evidence is there that my head is spinning.  That‚Äôs a bit what upsets you as you thought those reflective tactics of yours would work.

‚ÄúYou'd be much happier leaning more towards clarity and simplicity.‚Äù  Again your project your own flaws.  You using logical fallacies complicates.  Me giving direct answers and listening to what you have said does not complicate, it keeps it simple.  But you hoped your tactics would confuse and complicate as that is your way to avoid.

‚ÄúYou've overcomplicated all of this by writing way too much with little substance.‚Äù  Another projection in part of your own flaw.  You have yet to provide evidence or refute anything I have said.  You have spent your time avoiding and using logical fallacies.  That is you not contributing substance.

‚ÄúIf someone would ask me to elaborate, I would gladly. Assuming at least I'm confident in where I stand.‚Äù  Nice fallacy by you.  I have already provided my stance and have been so confident, I haven‚Äôt had to move off of it.  It‚Äôs you who simply have avoided.  You are also avoiding that your original reason to try to disagree failed as you have agreed with at least a couple of my examples if I remember correctly.

‚ÄúYou remind me of when I was younger‚Äù. Nice attempted ad hominem though it doesn‚Äôt work.  You are the one who is whining, saying something like ‚Äúbut you won‚Äôt repeat what you‚Äôve said, that‚Äôs not fair‚Äù as you are stomping your feet.  And it is your avoidance which sounds like someone saying ‚Äúla la la la, I can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù.  Those are not signs of maturity though that may not say anything about your true age, just maturity.

Reply: @@Mike-sp7zv ‚Äúonly six paragraphs this time. I wonder how many this one will get‚Äù you are starting to show your full snowflake mode.  The avoidance and insistence that I needed to provide what I already had (just so you could avoid further) were early signs.  Even your need to pretend we disagree when your words say otherwise was a sign.  Now you pretend like this is a bit of a game.  This is out of the snowflake toolbox where they want to make it seem they have a leg up on something, kind of a pretend inside joke yet there is no joke other than your failed responses.

And how do we know this is your reason, all your avoidance of my statements shows you are not looking forward to me responding.  And you stomping your feet proverbially insisting I repeat what you‚Äôve already been told is again you not looking forward to me responding.  So your one eighty trying to pretend now you are is another attempt for you to save face.

‚ÄúIf a hypothesis or theory turns out to be incorrect, it is a dusted to represent out best knowledge at the time.‚Äù  Most times but not all times.  You seem to not understand science fully.  Take for instance the Big Bang Theory.  Do you realize at least as of about 5 years ago, all models created indicated that there was not a singularity, ie there was no evidence and only contra evidence to the singularity, yet the theory continued to maintain there must have been a singularity at the beginning.  So science can remain stubborn and unchanging as well (the humans behind it).

Comment: Glad we can now all openly agree on something that was always a clear case of security theatre that some were wayyyyyyyy too personally and politically committed toward to accept defeat on. I dream that one day we will live in a democratic utopia where all who participate will analyse what they are faced with in an objective manner with the goal of truly getting to the bottom of the issue and how to best benefit society, not some backwards pissing match of spastics going "HEHEHE MY IDEOLOGY BETTER WE WIN, GET REKT LIBTARD/TRUMPTARD, I WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE AND USE PURPOSEFULLY MISLEADING, MISCONSTRUED AND EVEN NON-EXISTANT DATA TO JUSTIFY MY TEAM'S VIEWSSSSSS" but hey, maybe I should have just taken my pills this morning so the voices wouldn't have gotten to me.

Comment: SNL ... I have no words, after all the pro vax propaganda, forcing the kids to wear a muzzle, forcing people icluding children  to get an experimental injection, killing the economy, killing businesses,  now do a shameless U-turn... y'all end up in the shitter like CNN. The only thing good about that is that now we know how spineless humans are.

Comment: A lot of the mask stuff is baloney. Is it helpful if someone you are briefly meeting at the bank has it on , and reduces SOME of bacteria they sneeze/ breathe out? yes. Because a little bit of covid doesn't mean you will 100% get it. Now....if you are packed in a room full of mask wearing and everyone takes it off to eat, or is singing. Is the mask going to help much then? nope. You can't avoid a disease as easily by packing people together like sardines.

Reply: @John Jon  The problem is with the public when you are vague people will do dumb stuff like ignore there is a disease going around altogether. People followed the mandates better when the government was strict like "DONT SEE ANYONE WEAR YOUR MASKS KEEP AWAY!" and the numbers went down...but when they started to say "Eh wear two masks...wait just wear the one but make sure the people you meet are vaccinated and so on" then people just ignored all advice did whatever, and we had spikes. Whether you agree covid exists or matters or not, at this point following the rules so the government is happy enough to give us what we want is the only way to go. Or yknow...collect a bunch of folks and rally, which almost never works out.

Comment: Sure would have been great if this skit had come out around a year ago... when it was actually relevant.

This skit reeks of, "Okay, you caught us. We were acting like c@nts, but now that we aren't terrified by flip flopping, lying Fauci, we wanted to not apologize to everyone that we deeply f!cked, but instead, laugh about it. In this way, we will admit our many grievous errors, without taking responsibility for what we actually did to real, living people."

Remember the days when SNL used to matter?

So, I'm sick, yeah. Coughing.. sneezing.. I wear a mask, saves you some of sloppy goo that I achoo. Yet, I need to eat for 15mins so I do. Can you get sick if I need on you? Yep. Were you safe from that when I had my mask on? 90 percent, yeap. Oh, not 100? Well, no. If I touched a sloppy part of nose when I blew on a tissue then touched you.. ah.. that's transference without the mask. No. Masks won't help THAT.

Comment: That's because it is a cult and every single one of you at SNL helped create the cult. You get no kuddos from me for trying to unravel it until you sincerely apologize for your role. Shaming the mask nazis out of their masks is as despicable as the lies you helped propagandize, and the hate you helped foment towards those who were sharing truth from the beginning.

Comment: I like that this is honest and hilarious, and people do have to be careful what they say because you really don't know who believes what and it's such a hot button "issue"... For real, the science behind the pandemic DID change as more was known. Let's never forget this was a novel virus that raged around the world and caused the deaths of hundreds of millions of people. Personally I appreciate not getting sick over the last 2 years with anything, not even a cold, because of distancing and mask wearing (inside). I understand I got Omicron because of the way it mutated and spread in Dec '21, what with cloth masks not being able to shield from the smaller viral particles, but was thankful it was so mild due to vaccination mitigating much of the effects. I STILL appreciate not getting colds because masks at least shield from the spray from people coughing and sneezing in close quarters. We are very fortunate that scientists were already researching SARS vaccines, which allowed rapid development of the COVID vaccine, since COVID is a relative to those horrible viral diseases like SARS and MERS.  Science has always evolved and changed as more information is available.

Comment: While the sketch was funny, it reads a lot like pandering to that demographic which is tired of covid protocols and just looking to justify giving up entirely. Do what you want, but I'll still keep my mask. I haven't caught a bad cold or flu in ages. Wearing masks reduces your exposure to higher quantities of viral particles, covid or otherwise, and thereby decreases the likelihood of getting severely ill. Masks do work, but not all masks are equal. Sure, your cheap bulk order surgical masks probably don't do crap, but well fitted N95 and KN95 do actually help a lot. All masks help a little, but only some masks really do a good job--- something that's been said from the beginning. So yeah, everyone wearing a scrap of thin fabric (ie the dozens of people I've seen wearing neck gators) probably didn't meaningfully prevent the spread as much as it could have, but that doesn't negate the reality that good masks do help.  That's like telling everyone to put a seatbelt on in their car and people getting pissed off and buckling it but only wearing the lap belt and not the chest strap--- it's not going to protect you as much in the event of an accident, but that doesn't mean the people saying to wear a seatbelt were wrong, that means people aren't good at following directions so the directions we give to the general public needs to be adjusted and reevaluated.  Also, while it's a common colloquialism, "the science" is not, in itself, a Thing which exists in stagnant perpetuity, so it cannot really be said to have changed or not have changed. Science describes an intangible practice, the study and understanding of the world around and within us; as we collect/evaluate more data and as time permits deeper and more thorough study, our understanding naturally increases and evolves. We might refer to that data or that understanding as having changed by saying the "Science changed" but this is not accurate and unfortunately this willful misunderstanding of the contextual point is used by dolts and pedants to justify a complete disregard for the scientific process. At one point, people thought it was safe to put arsenic on your face and then, through time and study, we learned that it was not, in fact, safe. It could be said that "the science changed" in that situation and yet I'm guessing no one is taking issue with the fact that social adjustments were made in the consideration of public health.

But of course, no chances are ever taken on this show anymore and now that it's safe to make the obvious realization, it's time for a sketch, SNL freaking blows

Also, masks have clear benefits, vaccines a million times moreso. This is a pandering, disingenuous sketch and maybe a dangerous one. Gross.

Wearing a mask hurts no one, and more than likely helps keep your mouth vapor away from others. And looking at these comments you see just how invested people are in remaining right at all costs..."my opinions, wahhh, I've suffered with cloth on my face, waaahhhh."

Intelligent people were pointing out that the stupid masks were useless on day 1. Stop trying to weasel your way out of being wrong for over a year. Just accept that you acted like a sheep, learn from it and move on

Reply: They were even confused in their own skit. I'm very well informed on these topics, and couldn't tell what they were trying to say. Still covering and hedging. And not pointing a finger at themselves.

I don't see that for corporate censorship.  We have freedom of speech.... as long as it meets corporate approval.

Comment: The same people who wanted you to lose your job for not wearing a mask are calling masks stupid once they realize public opinion has shifted.  

SNL is so painfully self righteous and out of touch that their lack of self awareness in and of itself is funny.

Speech police like the ones portrayed in the video are a bunch of tyrannical animals.

To everyone else just know they're only doing this to ignore how we're aligning with Ukraine Neo-nazi with Germany to fight a World War because certain corrupt morons don't won't their slush funds to be cracked open. Sigh,  I recall when I didn't want the death of every tiny Tyrant in my neighborhood.  Now I know better.  Their blood or my son's. I chose their's and any moron thinking they are protecting anything by getting in the way.

Comment: 2 years ago they wouldn't of dared make this. Alot of the conspiracies we're damn true and people hated on ones speaking the truth. This is a slap in the face to everybody who was hated on. This is like "sorry I was a authoritarian jerk but I was wrong now let's just laugh it off until something else happens!"

Sure.  Sure, guys.  We totally believe you.  You guys were ALWAYS "secretly ahead of the sheeple", right?  That's what you want all the Democrats to believe, right?  Jesus, not even 2 months ago these very actors would have slayed your ass on Twitter for going into Sprouts without a ripped up piece of your grandma's T shirt sewn into a mask covering your mouth.  As if any mask that 99.99999999999% of people wore stopped a damn thing.  But no, they were always secretly against the lunacy, even though they never said anything, cause they'd lose their fuckin' jobs.  

The Democrat party has is 1% rich, authoritarian assholes, and 99% morons who will now find this funny because they are finally ALLOWED to find this funny.  You guys make me sick.

At what point is it okay to start wishing harm against these people? When can we finally cross that line?

Comment: I've avoided ever getting covid by constantly eating. I never go anywhere without a bag of sunflower seeds. People ask me where my mask is and I tell them no I'm eating so I cant catch it or transmitt it and theyre like Oh ok that makes sense. I dont even bring a mask on flights anymore, I just eat a peanut every 10 minutes whenever the stewardess asks about my mask I say no Im eating so they know I cant get covid or transmit it. When they hand out the free peanuts, I count all the peanuts and how much flight time is left to know how many minutes to wait  before my next peanut. 

I cant believe that guy got arrested for wearing a thong on an airplane, he should have just removed it and started eating and the airline would have left him alone.

When even the NYT has refused to review it, although it has sold close to a MILLION copies, you KNOW it's too hot to handle. The SNL writers would have quite a field day building skits around a LOT of the revelations about the science "saints". At least this skit reveals how STUPID this whole masks situation has been.

Comment: Oh now you jump on the train. But called every one Nazis who want to wear masks.  We have been saying this since the beginning. But you wanted to believe AIDS doctor who tortured puppies. Nice!

This will go down like the Patriot act. Every one will claim they never pushed masks or vaccines. But they are full of shit. It's hilarious how leftists are constantly wrong.

Comment: Do this sketch again only talking about how Biden's doing.
You know? The guy SNL told us was "cool", would "save" America and you were a "bad/stupid/racist" person if you didn't support  him.
Or how for 4 years SNL was telling us that "WW3" would happen under Trump which is why we needed Biden so badly.......yeah.....those all aged well.

I think SNL and other liberals need to start admitting they were wrong on a lot of other things for the last few yesrs.

Look  at allllll these comments pretending that they secretly knew all along that these rules were stupid, and yet they said nothing.  I can't believe how easy it is to get Democrats to do what they want.  It just takes one SNL skit and they all have their new marching orders.  It's insane.

Sorry but no, it was mediocre at best. And a crap half assed acknowledgement that they have been pushing authorization policy on the masses for 2 years now. Would have been funny 6 months in, not 2 years. You do realize this is the lefts way of "apologizing" for ruining many Americans lives, based off bad data and "science" from one side, canceling and ignoring any differing opinion. So no, its not funny, its a crap piece made by people who are trying to weasel their way out of being called out for what they are. And like its been pointed out, too convenient dropping this skit so close to the midterms. Its almost like the democrat establishment is scared of losing, because of what they have done to America

Comment: While the anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers are being rabid in the comments, I will chime in to say that masks do work! However, implementing them for restaurants was ridiculous which is why I didn't dine in until I was fully vaccinated, and when I did it was only a couple times at places that were less busy. Since restaurants aren't essential, the policy should have been a "dine in and stay open at your own risk" policy. We know that masks work and that the pandemic was serious because many restaurants that didn't implement masks for their employees had many fall sick and or quit due to being sick.
Things are calming down with the virus and I'm just glad that I made it out alive by doing all the things I needed to do to keep myself and those I care about safe.

Comment: This bothered me. The Bloomberg piece mentioned was an opinion piece by someone with no degree in medicine or even biology let alone a doctorate. Further the mentioning of science changing is absolutely true. As new data comes in you have to change your viewpoint. You can't just stick with what you want. That said the way admin handled things as well as a discussion over whether losing a job due to no vaccinations made good points. The other parts showed the writer doesn't know how science works or what a good source is.

Comment: There‚Äôs a reason the death rate is so low in Japan and many other countries based in cooperative rather than competitive cultures. Believe it or not, masks have been shown to prevent transmission while vaccines have not. I get what that they are trying to make fun of the polarizing beliefs that all CLAIM to have science behind them, but putting this on right as the Dem governors are pulling back on mask mandates for political reasons (ignoring that we are still losing 2000-3000 people a day) is SNL once again being a DNC ‚Äúliberal‚Äù mouthpiece.

Comment: From the beginning we were told by all the medical experts that the only masks that work against any virus are N95. They begged us to not hoard them because medical staff and first responders needed them. I watched all the news and was very concerned when this first started. I quarantined my mail and wiped my groceries with chlorine solution...and wore N95 masks I already had on hand that I wear during pollen season while mowing the grass (they are great for that by the way).

On a TV interview, Fauci was pressed, "do paper and cloth masks help at all?". He hemmed and hawed and finally said, "well, they are probably better than nothing". A total reversal from what "experts" and "science" told them from 100 years of virology.

Then it was on. Cottage industries were formed, people had a purpose, they made masks and gave them out, thinking they were doing something...totally ignoring everything the "experts" told us unequivocally at the onset of this...this...I cant even say what I really believe because this is YouTube...Google...

The immunocompromised are the greatest risk for serious illness from any virus. Those folks already deal with deadly flu viruses, the COVID virus (AKA the common cold, which can be terribly nasty for some people) and are at risk any time they go in public. The idea that suddenly, wearing a mask that doesn't stop any virus, protects anyone, put those people at greater risk with a false sense of security.  The entire mask frenzy was B.S. from day one...the day "they" decided it would become "policy" in media...I'm sorry..."science"...which is policy...

I only wore a cloth or paper mask to avoid the "Walking Vaxxed Covidians". These people are nuts. I prefer to avoid them and I'm perfectly fine with them cutting me from their life, family or not. This is why free speech should always be preferred...you can tell the nutjobs easily. COVID exposed the crazy and the sheeple. And also the freethinkers...and sadly, we are now clearly identified...by NOT being on the vaccinated list...oh, and my wife and I, never sick...the entire time.

Comment: No one watches this show anymore. I'm serious. Ask everyone you know "Hey do you actively watch SNL?" Other than the fake shill comments here from the cast members' families, production assistants and crew that works on SNL, nobody watches it. "12.7 Million Subscribers". Must be a lot of paid bot accounts that NBC is paying for the channel.

No one watches this. SNL has been dead since Will Ferrell left back in the early 2000's.

Go ahead and bury or erase my comments, YouTube.  But I'm right. Nobody watches SNL because it's cringe shit that that hasn't been funny since 2004.

Reply: @John Jon  I get so tired of anti semites.  It's not so much the bigotry and prejudice.   Although, yeah,  it's awful and stupid.   It's the simple fact that they zero in on one of the most marginalized people groups of all time and woefully blame THEM for everything wrong in this world.   As if a white, black, Asian, Indian, or indigenous person isn't fully capable of committing abject horror in the modern era.    It's so f#cking dumb.  Short sighted.   

Meanwhile in reality, not a single Jewish person is fingered in the Panama, Pandora, or Paradise Papers.  Idk.  Maybe a couple.  But not enough to spark this b.s.

Comment: With as often and as wrong as the left has been over the past decade, this could (and should) be a reoccurring skit. 
I can't wait until they all admit that there was no Russian collusion with Trump and that it was all an outright lie by Christopher
Steele that was paid for by Hillary. 
I'm just kidding, I know that this is their limit on admitting that their pretention, sanctimony, and egos wont' allow them
to be human beings. Only smug, characteurs, who believe themselves above the unwashed masses.

Comment: So SNL admits that this is a nuanced and difficult topic (nuanced meaning there is not a clear answer one way or the other) and people in the comments are like ALL LIBS ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING

Like yes it is difficult. People with questions about masks and vaccinations should be allowed to voice those questions.

But the science has not changed. Masks work‚Ä¶ when they are worn correctly and everybody wears them. And the CDC hasn‚Äôt done away with masks. They‚Äôre just changing it so that they suggest you wear a mask when there are more infections in your area, and you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask if there are less infections in your area. It seems pretty reasonable to me.

Comment: So many people in these comments missing the entire point and just hearing what they wanna hear. Smh
I've never heard a single reputable source claim masks are no better than nothing at all, or that they never have been even in earlier stages of the pandemic. Because it's not true. 
What they say in the sketch is true: it may be years before we understand better. That doesn't mean masking was and always has been ineffective. That's a gigantic leap to an unsupported conclusion.

Comment: THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

The Fascist Woke Media, that includes SNL, has been pushing LIES, HATE AND DIVISION for years.
They contributed to people losing their jobs. The contributed to the mental stress of children, resulting in the spike in suicides, drug addiction, and drug related deaths.

And they DARE MAKE FUN OF THE DESTRUCTION THEY HELPED TO CREATE?

Evil Woke Cult Scum.
We know who the deplorable are now.  We know that the Woke Cult sent the FBI after parents. We know that the Woke Cult committed treason by spying on a sitting president.  We know the Fascist Democrats Woke Cult are all pathological LIARS.

Go ahead and try to pivot away from your absolute stupidity and authoritarianism.  We know what you really are.

Reply: I've been hiking the Appalachian Trail (literally; up in the mountains, away from civilization) and have passed other hikers along the trail who asked me where my mask was and told me I "had to wear it because of 'muh mandate'." I challenged them to call the cops and "put me in jail for breaking the law". Then I kept walking.

Comment: Yes this makes them look like hypocrites - that's kind of the point of the whole sketch, how uncomfortable that situation is. I don't think it makes sense to blame SNL for mocking COVID moderates too hard earlier because they were just mirroring how people felt in New York/Manhattan - a lot more extreme than in other places. They're comedians, they play to their audience and actively avoid controversy. Unfortunately in this case, the actors are in a bit of a bubble that makes this sketch unrelatable to most people in other parts of the country.

Comment: SNL seems so safe and cautious nowadays. This sketch feels like it would have been brave 8-12 months ago, but they don't dare go against the grain anymore. This one feels all the more disingenuous as it openly represents how they preach to the choir yet, pat themselves on the back for being anarchic. Which they are not. They smugly delude themselves that they have an edge...when the show is no more lawless than a Nickelodeon production. Another prime example is how Kate McKinnon became famous for impersonating Ellen Degeneres, but THE SECOND Ellen actually had something scandalous and potent about her to satirise (the revelation of her toxic personality and ill treatment of her underlings) McKinnon downed tools. Proof that the previous performances were toothless exercises in showbiz shoulder-rubbing. Compare that to how, say, Norm incurred the wraith of network execs yet, never ever backed down. That's all you need to know.

Comment: Another bad effect of wokeism is it turns us from "compilers" into "interpreters." Once certain words are released into a sentence, they have effects that cannot be reversed or modified by subsequent words, the context, or the structure of the finished sentence. You can pass the point of no return with a single word choice.

Comment: More of the same--Elites and Hollywood making our lives worse and then they mock us about the mess they created. We are nothing but a joke to them. This really isn't funny when you think about it. It is just "the haves" mocking "the have nots" over all the chaos they created for us since the 2020 shutdown of society.  It is their way of trying to sweep it all under the rug and act like it was not a big deal. It is a big deal. They withheld life-saving treatments many credentialed medical professionals were speaking about that could have saved many, many lives. They censored them and belittled them because they wanted their message of fear porn to be heard and to cause the regular Americans to turn on each other. We are nothing but a joke to them. I hope people turn off their TVs and tell these power-hungry evil people to shove off because we won't buy the crap they are selling anymore. I wish this is what the majority will do, but their programming power is too strong for too many weak minded.

Comment: This was funny. But, the LIE that masks don‚Äôt work is just that, a LIE. I used to get the flu every year despite getting the flu shot. (the shot made both the severity & the duration less than without the shot) Since the pandemic, NOT ONE CASE OF FLU. Only differences?  Wore the mask. Stayed away from crowds. Case closed.

Comment: Why the fuck is it wrong to be extra careful of a brand new virus that we didn't know anything about? It's wild to me that conservative conspiracy theorists at one point say it was bioengineered in a lab by our biggest threat (China), but then at another point say that it was safe to get infected before we had any conclusive data. You're not worried it's a biological attack meant to affect you long-term while you're "greatest enemy" had an antidote? I'm so confused by the logic.

Comment: I don't understand this sketch. Masks and vaccines were needed and slowed spread... the skit should have focused on how stupid the mandates were executed and not on the actual science. Also, the science of the CDC has been faulty ever since they focused on politicians and not what epidemiologists were saying. They changed recommendations to meet expectations despite the data coming in being consistent

Comment: Two things happening here.  One good one disgusting.  Good - All of this COVID theatre needed to end and until it became the predominant message on mainstream media it never would.  So the changing of the narrative had to eventually take place and SNL is a "safe" way to approach the subject with a comedic spin.  But here's the disgusting.  You're making a parody of the fact that 10000's of people were fired from their jobs with ZERO CAUSE just for saying words lifted VERBATIM from this skit.  And everyone who watches SNL and pumped this entire mask/vax/mandate charade were the ones CALLING for that to happen.  You WANTED people to be punished, you wanted people to be denied medical care, lose their jobs, be severed from their friends and families, all because they were skeptical of masks and vaccines.  You tried to pass a Federal Law REQUIRING others conform to your OPINION.  Those people i'm describing - you've been revealed.  And unless the SINCERE apologies start coming in droves, you'll be remembered for exactly how you treated other's during this time.

Comment: At least the left can poke fun at how hysterically insane they've been. Next step would be admitting people they've vilified as "white supremicists" and "terrorists" - who've been looking at the actual data for years now - had some good points. But they won't, statist liberals will just chant "the science has changed" and keep smelling their own farts.

Comment: Summary: The SNL guy who's been on the show way too long, the fat broad who was excited to play a real-life woman who was excited to get an abortion, John Mulaney, the painfully-unfunny broad who doesn't want you to forget she's a lesbian, and two new cast members who won't be around next season star in a poorly-written "sketch" about the truth of the CDC, media, and government's disinformation campaign regarding COVID.

Comment: ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨We've known all of this the entire time... there was NO SCIENCE saying mask stopped the spread or even helped.
The science did not change, simply read any of the studies on mask from 1998 - 2020..... they are all the same.

The media told the left to be authoritarians and just like under Hitler the left rose to the occasion... 

We should force leftist to learn economics and philosophy to de-radicalize them.... 

They don't understand that they are actual Nazi's... because they've been told that Nazi's are right wing... this is an ignorant view that people who know nothing about Nazi's believe.

The media and politicians used the ignorance of the left against them to be ok with following the exact actions that Hitler did... 
- Health Passports (In Germany they were called Volksgefundheidt)
- Blaming the disease on their political opposition (Hitler said Typhus was a pandemic of the jews / biden said covid was a pandemic of the unvaxxed which is not based in science at all)
- Firing political opposition from their place of employment (There was no scientific reason to fire unvaxxed, we now know they had more protection than the vaxxed, natural immunity is better than the vax according to pretty much every study out right now)
- using the medical establishment to lie about the science. (97% of Doctors joined the Nazi party....)

More than half of all German physicians became early joiners of the Nazi Party, surpassing the party enrollments of all other professions. From early on, the German Medical Society played the most instrumental role in the Nazi medical program, beginning with the marginalization of Jewish physicians, proceeding to coerced ‚Äúexperimentation,‚Äù ‚Äúeuthanization,‚Äù and sterilization, and culminating in genocide via the medicalization of mass murder of Jews and others caricatured and demonized by Nazi ideology. Given the medical oath to ‚Äúdo no harm,‚Äù many postwar ethical analyses have strained to make sense of these seemingly paradoxical atrocities.

If Democrats knew the science rather than repeating what the media and politicians told them far less people would have died.

Thank God the elites have notified us that it's now okay to say very obvious truths about an airborne virus and ridiculous bureaucracy

I also worked at a place where a person went around spraying Lysol over everyone's heads, just minding my own business and it's raining Lysol in my face.. but I didn't see anyone distancing out on their smoke breaks!

Or dragged them and your fan base for a year for not complying? Was it worth having no real thought for yourself to take these things as far as they did? I hope it was. I hope the best for you.

It's mocking the state of political correctness in a show that put PC directly in front of comedy during the pandemic, and yet this sketch isn't self-aware. It isn't sympathetic to the lives disrupted by these measures, and it simply isn't funny.

Me?  I knew this was a farce when the back-to-work protesters in Michigan in 2020 were made to look like Natzis.  People had bills to pay and the government/media system made them look like criminals.  A month later there were *BLM* riots and the masks were not needed.

Reply: ‚Äã@@kylecameron195 Ok, so you're being serious. Yes, you did do what you're told to do without questioning authority, even though there were plenty of red flags screaming that what they were asking didn't make a lick of sense. You are such a good obedient follower of the system. There's going to be a hell of a lot of information coming out soon about what's really been going on and you're going to be practicing some severe cognitive dissonance in order to rationalize and justify your strange actions of the past two years

Comment: Liberals now admitting to facts that conservatives have said for more than a year.  My wife, kids, and I all were locked away in our home for two months.  When the data started to roll out we backed off and went on with our lives.  Once we all got Covid we felt like crap for a day and worked from home.  Our kids never even showed a symptom but the left is still screaming for them to be vaxed and masked.  But the left has ruined the scared the hell out of people for two years.  The leaderships intent was to use it as a way to gain additional power.  They went after anyone that disagreed with them in social media, and even their jobs.  Welcome to the party guys.  Your only about a year and half late.  I love when they admit "the science doesn't change."  Your right, you didn't listen to science.  You listened to hysteria.

Comment: This is the first conversation I heard about (jabbed and masked) people wondering if they were wrong, and that it doesn't make any sense. Now I need a conversation about what actually changed. SNL did part of a season virtually for Pete's sake. Just as much covid we had a year ago but things are open and mask mandates are dropping. What the hell changed?

I didnt wear masks in the patient's rooms unless there was a sign and had colds and viruses over the years.  I wear 2 masks at work. I like not getting sick.

Reply: @@skdewolf7606 I was hand washing before. However patients with trach collars cough unexpectedly. When you give physical therapy treatments to patients in an acute setting you get them sitting edge of bed with max assist  and they are pretty close to you. I always wash going in and going out of a room. It was usually patients coughing or some other unexpected body fluid from them. Do not assume I didnt wash my hands.  I notice alot of people like to point fingers at others. Just sometimes accept someone's positive comment without creating a false accusation. Have a nice day. Every day is a blessing.

That's exactly what I did, and if everybody did that, they would not stand a chance.

She said after 9 months it should be ok. I asked for more details about what it was oozing out of me but she didnt have much.

The height of comedy asking a massage therapist your medical condition. Go to a doctor who knows something perhaps? I bet you got your shots in the parking lot of a Chuck E. Cheese.

Comment: Very poignant, NBC, using the clip of Brendan Frasier laughing his ass off at the Hollywood pedophiles who destroyed his career getting ripped apart on live, national TV by Ricky Gervais by the way.  Love it.

Reply: I left Fakebook when all this hoopla was going on.  I saw how asleep people were and how much they resisted being woken up, and I was like, "well, have fun with that".  Ironically, I'm not part of the right or even right leaning.

We adopted the mask protocol because it showed a significant difference in stopping the spread of Covid in other countries. The people losing their jobs are the morons that chose to take risks and be sorry.

Comment: I seem to recall Biden calling DeSantis and other GOP governors neanderthals for dropping mask mandates and not enforcing vax mandates.  That kind of shutting down the opposition and personal attacks is what needs to be chronicled when we look back at this.  Stop censoring the free exchange of ideas, and challenging authority simply because it does not play into your ideology.

Comment: Too bad millions of people lost their jobs over mandates and our youngest children will suffer from learning disabilities due to blocking the human face when conversing.  Then there are the people who have hearing disabilities that rely on lip reading.  Any mention of having a dissenting view either got you cancelled, fired or fact checked on social media.  Yep, really funny stuff.

Reply: If you tried to sell a car under the same conditions that they push vaccines, no one would buy one. People understand that the main reason cars are safe is because you can sue the ever living bejeezus out of a car manufacturer if you are damaged due to faulty design or manufacture of their product. These are corporations we are talking about. They have no conscience, but they fear punitive damage awards. You can't sue Pfizer, Moderna, et al for any damage done to you by their vaccines. All you can do is beg the government for a pittance from the fund that is supplied by a surtax on every vaccine. The pharma companies have no skin in the game as far as your safety is concerned. Never trust anyone without skin in the game.

"So you admit that you have no expertise. So your comments do not prove shit."

Comment: No, fuck this noise and fuck this skit. You don t get to jump ship now. People have been silenced, cancelled, they have lost jobs, careers, bodily independence, the actual freedom of simply going outside. Generations have been robbed of milestone moments in their development and life (early education, socialization, first day of elementary, prom, graduations...). Everyone was a conspiracy theorists, a novax/no brain, flat earther and so on. You have broken families, workplaces, friendships and essentially divided the fabric of society, and now you make fun of it? Pretending that it was idiotic all along? There needs to be accountability, there needs to be apologies and reparations for all the people that have been hurt for speaking the truth when it wasn't the left-approved truth yet. The science didn't change and you never followed it, now you don't get to switch sides. You stay on the left, keep your mask on forever, never be more less than 10 feet away from another human being, and get a jab every 2 months because covid is still here like it was a year ago

Comment: The only reason why the CDC is allowing people to not wear masks when eating is to pacify violently ignorant people and help restaurants not go out of business, because our government will bail out corporations without batting an eye, but won't pay for universal basic income to allow stricter precautions like other countries who have less deaths. It's not because we never needed masks and vaccines - that's ludicrous and irresponsible to insinuate during a fucking pandemic. The only reason why people feel more lax and safe is because of the precautions and vaccines we took. Technically, we should still keep our masks on and social distance until Covid dies off, but it's impossible to reason with stupid. üôÑ

Comment: What a mighty convenient sketch, just in time for the 2022 midterms. You know when this skit would have been appropriate? A year ago when these same people threatened covid/restriction skeptics their jobs and livelihood over masking and vaccine. So no, this isn‚Äôt some sort of ‚Äúnewfound‚Äù knowledge; ppl who saw through the covid charade already same through this conclusion a year ago, even 1.5 years ago in mid-2020 when we were all forced to lockdown but then riots can go abound because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶justice.

"wear a mask or everyone will die"
"winter of severe illness and death for unvaccinated"
"get the vax or lose your job"
"get the vax or you have no right to healthcare"
etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

are now parodying all of this in a comedy sketch. They really think we're stupid and that we're just going to forget about the disgusting totalitarian framework that they developed and abused for two years.

Everyone needs to understand that the globalists, marxists, leftists, elites absolutely hate us. They think we have the brain capacity of a goldfish. These people sicken me.

Comment: Now it's cool to laugh at this? It's convenient timing. The dems are at an all-time low politically and elections are on the horizon. The truth is ooozing out of every pore of the fabric of our society - there is no holding it back. So SNL, the NYTimes and others are jumping on board and trying to save their reputations? They want to be on the right side of history and 'scientific facts'? F^ck you, Lorne Michaels and SNL - you are shills of the cabal. Have you forgotten about the rate of teen suicides in this country because of these draconian, insane lockdowns and mandates that are STILL GOING ON in many towns and schools? Is SNL going to put out a parody of boys dying of myocarditis next?

Comment: I totally get the feeling behind this sketch, and I think there is some legitimacy to it. But I still wear my mask. One because it's required where I work, but two I haven't gotten sick with anything (besides a few bouts of alcohol poisoning) since this whole mess started. At this point, to not wear it would feel like being naked when you forget to put your watch or whatever on.

Reply: Yeah I hope these people saying masks don't prevent anything don't mind when their surgeon decides not to wear a surgical mask or scrub down before cutting into them. When more people were wearing masks I didn't get any colds or anything. As soon as other people stopped wearing masks consistently, I got a crazy cold that was awful. I don't want other people's spit and breath on my face!! Your "personal freedom" doesn't give you a right to stand super close to me, touch me, or cough directly in my face. Every time I've had to ask a man to stand further away from me he's acted so offended, like I've insulted him, and talked back to me. Which I'm sure most of them WOULDN'T do if I were also a man. üòí I'm going to go fully Japanese on this one and stay masked in public for a loooong time.

Reply: @@Alex-hb1yf I am pro-science. Once again, for the reading impaired, and pay attention this time, I am not arguing the efficacy of masks in terms of COVID transmission. I am sharing anecdotal evidence of how I have not gotten sick since wearing a mask. Which is why I choose to continue wearing one. Does that choice harm you in any way? Nothing else in my life or behavior has changed in the past two years. I didn't get sick often before thanks to the army pumping me full of god-knows-what, but since I haven't gotten sick *at all*, minus just recently. The only change was the mask. I'm not saying I'm going to wear it forever, either. Simply saying I believe it's kept me from falling ill. You can disagree all you want, but I see no other reason why I have gone the past two years without catching anything.

Comment: I worry this sketch conflates the ridiculous nature of what the US calls a "mandate" with blaming scientists for not being prognostic. We didn't take off our masks to eat because the scientists decided that was a good idea. They tried saying shut everything down and you threw temper tantrums as grown ass adults until the rules were bent your way. I hope the Covid era is a lesson for everyone: letting cult-politics and mob-mentality guide your decisions is as asinine as a mask at a restaurant. Remember the scientists wanted 3 weeks of isolation including businesses, you wanted pizza and beer, so we got 3 years of pretend safety for the pretend adults. Complaining about getting what you asked for would be how americans move on, would hate to learn from it!

Now go support the truckers, because that‚Äôs happening today and actually requires some goddamn balls. 

Celebrities have been trying to get people permanently removed from society for Covid shit that they‚Äôre now going ‚Äúehhhhhhhhhhhhh maybeeeeee‚Äù like no you don‚Äôt get a pass. You‚Äôre not a warrior. You‚Äôre just taking the path of least resistance, and happy to see anyone hang who dissents.

The fact that that is the writers/editors idea of a funny meme edit just shows you who these tone deaf fossils are. I understand comedy is subjective, but every forced laugh line in this sketch was such lazy silliness for siliness' sake... I just don't know how you could have found this funny unless by some measurable metric you just have not experienced enough comedy in your life

Comment: So funny... but tell that to tens of millions insulted, ridiculed and humiliated each day by the mainstream media for simply saying the exact damn thing 1 year ago!!

Oh, and how many doctors have been bullied and censored for stating facts far more "problematic" than masks? I know at least ten of very competent doctors that were bullied to hell and back for daring, DARING, to suggest that an MRA vaccine will never be able to offer the same level of protection as the infection itself, and that vaccinating those that already survived is stupid and pointless.

Guess we can all laugh now at how an entire society was indoctrinated, sorry, I mean "forcefully educated" by a handful of bureaucrats and their corporate masters! 

Oh, and how the social platforms and tech giants instantly censored all debates, sided with the authorities and starting banning everyone that dared to even question the narrative!

So, yeah, let's all laugh now! Ha ha ha ha... like this never ever happen, or will happen to us again!

Until next time of course.

Comment: Good comedy is like a religious ritual where a society's psychic burdens are expunged. I was just in east Nashville over the weekend and was surprised to see there are still shops fully engaged in this mass formation mask madness. Then there were the annoying yard signs in trendy neighborhoods telling the rest of us that they were "UNITERS" not dividers. What a sick time we've all just gone through!

SNL has become the propaganda mouthpiece for the self righteous woke cult. boy, have you lost the comic relief in your quest for virtue signaling. my apologies to polite society for using the noun "boy", i should have phrased it better... non-binary. 

SNL, thank you for the politically incorrect era of Chevy Case to Molly Shannon. the decline started with Tina Fey. when comedy becomes politically correct and censored, you've lost the formula of being edgy. it was a pleasure to witness your greatest work.

Comment: Just in time for SNL to pivot to the new set of lies to steer globalist B.S. into mass hysteria....
Solidarity with the oppressed "Ukrainian People" against the "Fascist Russians". Never mind that the Ukrainian leader was essentially installed in a 2014 Western backed coup that overthrew the democratically elected government in Kiev. Never mind that the actual Fascist rule the West, and less so the East. Never mind that this conflict has been egged on by the United States and its satellite regimes. Never mind that it was the West that reneged on agreement after agreement with the Eastern powers.
NOPE.... here is all you need to know little people - 
Russia = Totalitarianism, violence, conquest, hatred, the killing of puppies... the black hat guys in a western spaghettis movie 
Ukraine = Freedom, democracy, love, peace and national sovereignty.... the white hat guys

Yep... that's all you need to know. Russia bad, Ukraine good. 
So now SNL, put on a bunch of Ukrainian singers belting out a patriotic tune while your so-called "comedians" light candles that spell out "Kiev", as if you give two shits about what the truth is concerning the geopolitical realities that lead up to this mess.

Right now Idaho, the most Republican state by percent of population, is also the state with the highest rate of COVID infection (by far). Sorry that unfortunate statistic doesn't happen to align with your belief system.

Comment: SNL You stabbed comedy in the back. I've watched for decades and now I can't even watch this garbage. Start apologizing and maybe your little skit show will survive. Okay had to edit this. This was kind of funny. As long as you keep making skits about how stupid you all are then we'll be better. But at LEAST 3 more skits about how you all were wrong and how you're all corporate suck-ups and fake narrative spinners, Then we should be good again. 3 more. This one doesn't count. Got it?

Comment: You did an amazing job of destroying your own economy and I really hope it was worth it. Science says it wasn't since it had no effect and lockdowns did nothing but hey maybe you have some other things that say at the opposite. :*

Comment: When comedy lags behind political doctrine it's not comedy it's.... ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  whatever this is. These same cast members played out these ridiculous roles in real life for over a year now. This isn't comedy writing it's the experience of any conservative talking to any liberal for the last two years. Edgy!

Comment: For the record, the mask mandates are NOT being repealed because masks don't work. They're being repealed because in low-risk areas most people are vaccinated so they are no longer as necessary and we have more information about COVID so we know who is most at risk. Surgeons and doctors will continue to wear masks to protect sick patients. Masks work. It is common sense.

Reply: Not 100% effective, but better than nothing given the N95 mask shortage. 

Hiroshi et al. 2020 found "A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined... In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission"

Reply: For most people, being wrong on an ordinary day is difficult...
Coming to terms with being subject to mass psychosis is going to be a real challenge for so many... I predict a great deal of cognitive dissonance and continuing to blame others.

The best we can hope for is uncomfortable attempts at humor to try and move on, because most will never apologize for their behavior, enabling the destruction of other people's livelihoods, relationships, freedom of speech and sense of reality... let alone outright admit that they were wrong.  

They'll perform whatever mental gymnastics are needed to make the equivalent Nuremberg defense work for them... "We were just doing what we were told to do." 

Hopefully, that isn't acceptable. I would very much like to see some accountability. 
At the very least, some resignations/firings without benefits, and possibly legal liability for those most responsible for the perpetration of propagandizing and terrorizing Americans for profit and ratings these past couple of years.

Comment: eh. so before i get into this i'm not left wing or right wing. i think both sides have an occasionally good point but tend to get a lot wrong. they both preach facts matter but tend to live in their echo chambers where they never have to hear facts that challenge their pre-conceived bias. this skit is honestly way too late to actually be funny or edgy. a lot of this information about studies regarding masks/lockdowns overall effectiveness has been out for a while. anytime i mentioned them i was borderline crucified and immediately insulted even after offering to show my references to prove i just wasn't some delusional conspiracy idiot. one was from john hopkins university for christ's sake. hell this very show had plenty of skits mocking people like me who did nothing except read the science and have a little common sense.  

when i see politicians who were mega mask mandate/vaccine mandate all of a sudden do a 180 it's obvious as to why. midterms. they know the average american is tired of this shit and they're on the losing side.

Comment: This sketch is honestly one of creepiest things I've seen. Sure, the jokes themselves are funny, but the messengers and the past two years just give it weird vibes. I remember when SNL did a sketch a while back and made Andrew Cuomo out to be a huge hero. This was already well after we knew about the nursing home carnage. That all of a sudden basic observations, like wearing masks to walk to your table and then taking them off for 45 minutes at a restaurant won't stop transmission, are okay and not verboten/heresy/literally killing people, I dunno, it just feels off.

These are psychopathic plutocrats and they play and fund both sides as is convenient for them.  Notice how it hasn't mattered in the last 60 years if Democrats or Republicans were in power--the wars and battles still raged consistently through "changing of the guard" between these two.

Then there's the whole Fauci experimentations and funding, but of course I'm not going to be censored for it now like I was for pointing out his history not even 6 months ago. 

It's all disgusting hypocrisy of people who like ruling the world. And just like the social dynamic of high school they emulate, those popular kids love hating and controlling everyone they feel is below them, aka the ones who do their homework and know the material.

Comment: They say that in comedy "timing is everything" so what do you say when you are over a year late with a punchline? With the liberal shills at SNL it's not funny, it's sad and that's why SNL is dead.

Even after vaccines, I waited until everyone else was able to get vaccinated before doing away with the buff when passing outside.  I was also boostered when we could and wear a mask at work.  I work in science and studied microbiology.  Yet, people were looking at me when I was 20 feet away outside running as if I killed their puppy.  Meanwhile, those same people take off their mask when they go into a bar or party with friends thinking "you can't get it from family or friends"üßêü§îüòíüôÑ. Some people just don't have common sense.

Comment: Hate to be that guy but... The Bloomberg article is an opinion piece that has to be compared to many many scientific articles that actually proposed masks did have an effect. It's one piece that argues a point, but many other articles throughout 2020 and 2021 have argued otherwise. Which means two things: 
1. The article may not have a monopoly on the truth regarding masks. 

2. It was understandable given the scientific messages about mask wearing that people took the advice seriously.

Then there's the point of people losing their jobs over not getting vacinated. Sure that's a very rough decision to make, but once again, the fact that a lot of restrictions can be lifted without them being followed by an increase in deaths and hospitalisations is a result of vaccination and the virus weakening with Omicron.

Before there were vaccines every spike in cases was followed by a similar spikein deaths. If enough (especially vulnerable) people were convinced vaccines weren't necessary more people would have died, that's undeniable, so being critical of people's choices to not get vaccinated is understandable when we're talking about a disease that's closing in on killing 6 million people. 

With regards to him no longer talking to his friend because she didn't take a booster...who tf actually did that?! That's so dumb on so many levels regardless of Covid. If you know someone with a different opinion than you or someone that's moving into a different direction than you politically KEEP TALKING TO THEM! If you isolate yourself fr people who think differently it will cause you to enter an echo-chamber and them entering an echo-chamber.

About the science changing... Yes through the Popperian method of scientific inquiry new experiments are able to change the scientific consensus. That doesn't mean the truth which science tries to uncover changed, but it does change how clearly we are able to see it. It's like looking in the distance and seeing people walking. At first you squint your eyes and say: "Looks to be about fifty people walking there." Then they get closer, you count them and it's actually 45 people. That doesn't mean that 5 people just disappeared and your initial inquiry was total bullshit. With new facts you uncovered a clearer truth. If science actually was stable it would be more like dogma's such as religion, traditions, myths and superstitions. 

The part about the UK doing more testing so they got more Covid... That's the fallacy of correlation=causation. Testing is+was very necessary because it could trace how Covid spread. If I got Covid, and I had mild symptoms but I couldn't get tested and I got into contact with my vulnerable grandfather pre-vaccine, I might've unknowingly been the cause of his death. 

If I knew I was close to someone who tested positive, so I got tested, found out I had it, I would avoid my grandfather at all cost. 

All in all, I don't hear ANYTHING in this video that makes me feel like I took things too far or was irrational or that the cuck MSM lib soyboy media propagandized me into following all this bullshit policy. 

It all still makes sense to me, I didn't go overboard with following the policy. Wearing the masks seemed like a small sacrifice of comfort for the cause of helping a big problem. If that turned out to be wrong I can point to plenty of scientific journals that tried to convince me otherwise at the time I started wearing them. 

The vaccines did matter, immensely in fact. Lockdown measures did matter, you can't make someone sick if you don't see them that's a simple truth. We're not dealing with the same Covid crisis we did in early 2020. I remember Italians literally having to let elderly people die so they could save younger people. It wasn't a mild disease, it spread like wildfire and it has killed a lot of people before their time. 

Here's a good shorthand, if you have a belief that's convenient to belief for you, question the shit out of it. Wearing a mask was NOT convenient for me. Not being able to travel to my girlfriend was not convenient for me. Not being able to partake in my hobbies was not convenient. Covid was not convenient to me at all, so why would I force myself to believe in something that almost exclusively had negative effects on my personal lives. 

The other way around. Not having to put on masks, convenient! Not respecting measures and going on living like nothing was happening, convenient! Looking away from the fact that your personal choices may have inadvertently led to more deaths, super convenient! Et ceter et cetera.

Comment: How stunning and brave to mock the actions taken on Covid now that its necessary to save the Democrats.
This would have really been brave to do a year ago.
All these performers were cheering on people getting fired.
Here's the thing.
We will remember come November all the pain and suffering you inflicted primarily so that you could use Covid to gain power.
The science never changed, you just hid the data and eventually the truth came out anyway.
I made the choice to get vaccinated, but don't condemn those that did not because, the truth is, some people had some nasty side effects
and if you are under 30 weighing the risks makes 100% sense.
Most masks were always useless to protect people, they only aided people from potentially reducing the spread of disease.
You could still become sick and be a carry of Covid no matter what you did.

Comment: This would've been funny............................2 years ago when it f**king mattered and there was a price to pay for pushing the envelope.  Now SNL is trying to claw their way back to the center when convenient.  Too late.

Comment: So they get credit for what republicans/conservatives have been saying for over a year‚Ä¶ nice. All those people yelling/scoffing at others for not wearing a mask or getting vaccinated hopefully have realized by now. It still makes me laugh when I see ppl wearing masks when they‚Äôre alone in their own car. Nonsense.

Comment: You‚Äôre not allowed to go to the Metropolitan opera unless you‚Äôve had your boosters. Even though having them doesn‚Äôt keep you from spreading it... so they are keeping people out why? For their safety? Are they going to talk about the 2000+ (hero)Healtcare workers who were fired for not wanting to get the poke? Now that we are so enlightened.

Comment: Not only was this skit not funny, it was cringe worthy. I never even cracked a smile. I recall the days when SNL was funny. It was 1990-something. I completely stopped watching after the Rock's child molesting robot skit. Lorn michaels is one sick puppy, & so are his actors, writers, & guests. Buh bye! üëã

Comment: jesus this comment section is stupid af. is there a targeted trend going from dumbasses that come here to upvote these ridiculous comments? "2 years ago blabla" well alot changed in 2 years. the vaccination grade is way higher, slowing/lowering hospitalization/infection rates, Omnikron is a lot milder then Delta, etc etc. there was ENOUGH reason for a mask mandate. there just isn't enough reason anymore to justify it going on.. fucking internet..

Comment: Just be brave for once SNL and take it a step further to admit TRUMP WAS RIGHT as usual. That's just not possible for the TDS left to do though. Even when it means giving up their own freedoms they're so petty they'd rather do that than admit Trump is right. More evidence liberalism is a cult and a mental disorder.

Reply: @@Bob5mith You're going to hurt yourself moving the goalposts constantly. First it was that they never make jokes about Democrats, an EASILY disprovable point. Now it's that they DO make jokes about Democrats but they're mild compared to the ones they make about Republicans. Hmm, if we assume this iteration of your premise is correct, maybe Republicans should stop being massive assholes who beg for ridicule.

Reply: @@sonofashepherd9910 First it's "SNL never makes jokes about Democrats." Now it's "Well, they make jokes but they're not as savage as the ones they make about Republicans." Pick a position and stay with it, please. 

As for "Hey, at least you found one," I said clearly that I was just supplying a single example to show that the original claim was inaccurate. Since then I have explained that anyone can simply type "SNL Democrat joke" into the search box and find many examples. 

As for the relative savagery of the jokes, maybe, just maybe, that's explained by the fact that the Republican Party has turned into a sick shadow of its former self. I'm no fan of the Democratic Party but the GOP is a shit show of enormous proportions and deserves all the ridicule anyone can heap on it.

Comment: Shameless pivoting. Will the covid cultists actually learn their lesson now? NEVER trust the establishment on ANY issue. Seek out ALL information, ESPECIALLY the information they're trying to suppress. Never trust someone who declares himself to be "The Science" like Fauci did. It's your duty as a free-thinking American to do these things. But they won't learn. They'll continue to eat up all the other intentional lies and deception from the establishment day in and day out.

Comment: Wait a minute. So you get to joke around and have a laugh when you admit to what the rest of us have been saying for 2 years? Except when we said it we were called conspiracy theorists, anti vaxxers, murderers, lost our job got silenced on social media‚Ä¶.

But you get to laugh about it. I‚Äôm glad our views make for great entertainment, your views destroyed an entire country. But hey! It‚Äôs election year. Gotta try and bring real votes to hide all the ‚Äúother‚Äù votes.

Comment: Midterms - what a magical time when Democrats can remove covid restrictions, while claiming victory over a pandemic they kept going for over a year. What a time to be alive. Reasonable people were saying this for over a year, but we were called conspiracy theorists. We followed the ‚Äúscience,‚Äù that never changed.

Wonder how funny being turned into a second class citizen and that being celebrated would be to you. Especially after finding out you were right from day one. Then seeing those same people joke about how silly it is. Not saying it isn't funny, but not going to let the tyrants forget what they did to their neighbors.

Comment: These are all things that were true more than a year ago, and yet people that said them were demonized and called names and accused of "killing grandma" while losing their jobs and life savings. The only reason that this I'd being even tacitly acknowledged is because midterms are coming and the left is terrified. America will not forget what has been done to deliberately destroy our lives in the last 2 years.

Comment: There were plenty of experts that disagreed with a lot of what the government recommended. But their voices were drowned out, beaten back, canceled, videos deleted. Just when we needed the whole of the medical and scientific community to ban together and work the problem we got politics instead. Dictators big and small desperately wanted the "Saved you from covid" check mark next to their names for election time. Relying on their government appointed experts. (Really?? does anyone think the best and the brightest work in government?)    The group depicted in this sketch highlight the problem with squashing any opinion that goes against the "experts". When were not allowed to express our opinion for fear of a backlash then this country has lost one of the most fundamental rights it was founded on.

But seriously, if people just got vaccinated and vaccinated their kids sooner, this would have been over this past fall and we wouldn't still be wearing masks.  Unfortunately, we were still doing autopsies every day on COVID patients a month ago. I know people who work from home are dubious about what's actually going on in the real world, but it was still killing a lot of unvaccinated people and immunocompromised people. very recently because there are stupid anti-vaxxers who want to wear masks forever and tank the economy.

I will NEVER support SNL or the cast again. I came here from Ben Sharipo. I hope you read this SNL and see how damaging your skits were to your audience during the pandemic.  How you contributed unhealthy jokes. Making fun of people who lost their jobs for not being vaccinated? Good luck in your crime infested city.

Reply: @@tjones5719   Not really, air is constantly moving, swirling, convecting around due to things like pressure and temperature differentials and movement of mass within enclosed spaces (walk by someone closely, and they can feel the air move like a weak wind). If the virus stays airborne and alive for any appreciable time, there is not much of an actual decrease. And the longer you stay in enclosed areas, the greater your risk. It's really just a pretend band aid for a gaping wound.  

   Meanwhile, I got Covid from my vaxxed partner (I'm not) along with our vaxxed friend who is a decade plus younger than us (We're in our early 40's and she is in her early 30's). My partner and I had about equal symptoms, severity, and it wasn't that big of deal for us except for tiredness for a week and a half after (and I temporarily had very dampened sense of taste and smell), but our friend got significantly more sick than myself.  Curious, two myths busted with one stone.

       There are more cases out there like this, than most vaxxed people want to objectively and open mindedly consider. Because the potential scary, uncomfortable truth is that people got duped by greedy corporations yet again. Pfizer has been forced to release its testing/trial data--keep an eye on that. 

     Every psychological experiment done in relation to authority and power urges (like Milgram) have shown that most people are rather easy to deceive, manipulate, and coerce when it involves a supposed "authority figure", and the huge majority go along with it (even against their own better sense of ethics/morality and will even hurt others), and only a small minority are independent, critically thinking, and self realized enough to rebel in these situations.  Something Mark Twain apparently realized well before any of these experiments were run, considering he said things like, "‚ÄúWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.‚Äù

   Wise words.  

   (Btw, one of the reasons why I'm not vaxxed besides seeing through the corporations early on, is because during my last childhood slew of vaccines, I became paralyzed from the waist down for about a week. My body is rather sensitive to foreign substances. Even a little MSG or caffeine has big effects).

Reply: @@justinw1765 There is no mystery to anything you said.  If you understand how mRNA vaccines work, you'll understand very easily that not every individual human is going to benefit equally from the same vaccine.  Some people will respond to it well, and others can have virtually no response.  And this is influenced by multiple variables, but amplified in people who are elderly or in generally poor health.  Three data points (you, your partner and your friend) do not statistically define the efficacy of the Moderna & Pfizer COVID vaccines for the entire population.  The people in my sphere who have been infected by COVID-19 lived or died within the typical expectations.  Every person I know who simply got vaccinated had the typical symptoms, while some had zero symptoms.  Of the unvaccinated I know who were infected, three were expected to die in the ICU, but recovered somewhat, while four did die in the ICU, and six dealt with symptoms for weeks, including some trips to the ER.  It seems like the original COVID-19 variant was the most lethal, based on my personal experience.  By now, it seems like the existing variants' potency is diluted, we have enough people vaccinated, and enough Republican Fox/Newsmax/OAN consumers who rolled the dice, got infected and didn't die, that the worst is behind us.  The thing that pi$$es me off the most is that the rebels you talked about are responsible for this crap not being put to bed back in early 2020, when we were all supposed to be quarantining.  There is NO reason for COVID-19 to have taken the toll on this country, on the globe, that it has.  It is 100% the responsibility of self-centered, self-entitled, babies who threw a f'n tantrum because they were mildly inconvenienced.  You can call them rebels all you want, but they're the single largest group of dead weight, mouth-breathing knuckle-draggers in all of human history.  The blood of almost a million Americans is on your rebels' hands (well the rebels that COVID didn't kill, anyway).

Reply: @@justinw1765          ‚ÄúNot really‚Äù all we are about to find is you moving the goalposts.  I honestly say that before I read the rest of your post (I do this on a phone so I cannot read the entire post at once).

‚ÄúAir is constantly moving, swirling‚Ä¶‚Äù This is a movement of the goal posts.  The discussion is whether masks cut down at all the spread but you are acting like the standard is that it prevents all spread.

‚ÄúIf the virus..there is not much of a decrease.‚Äù  And how do we know you moved the goal posts, this statement just agreed that there is a decrease which should of had you agreeing with my statement but you didn‚Äôt.  I really have seen illogical people like you a lot that‚Äôs why I could predict it.

‚ÄúMeanwhile, I got COVID from my carded partner‚Ä¶more sick then myself.‚Äù  Now you move to an anecdotal red herring.  Off the topic but you weren‚Äôt done being emotional with the moving the goal posts so you are ranting now.  The problem is anecdotal stories aren‚Äôt evidence.  So no you didn‚Äôt come close to ‚Äútwo myths busted with one stone.‚Äù  All you shared was that you can create a story that would seem that way, but without evidence we have to throw it out.

And look at what confirms we should throw it out.  You were so desperate to try to ‚Äúscore points‚Äù that you moved the goal posts and essentially changed my statement and the argument to something else.  This means to ‚Äúscore points‚Äù you are desperate enough to make things up.  And if you made it up once in this post, why wouldn‚Äôt we believe you would do it again.  So the only evidence we have is that your story is likely made up (not to mention statistically speaking your story is highly unlikely due to the lower symptom rates of vaxxed people, and that you likely do not know absolutely who transmitted the disease).

‚ÄúThere are more cases out there like this‚Ä¶‚Äù made up to support a narrative, yeah I know.  But statistically this is not what has happened on average even if your story was true.

‚Äú‚Ä¶than what vaxxed people want to objectively and open minded it consider.‚Äù  Another illogical statement as this is both a projection of your demonstrated flaw to vaxxed people and a strawman of most vaxxed people.  Your close mindedness is not hearing what I have heard from most vaxxed people, most vaxxed people say that masks, vaccines, etc. cut down the spread and cut down the symptoms statistically.  Cut down does not mean eliminate, does not mean there are not abnormal cases.  So the close mindedness and lack of objectivity demonstrated is all yours.

‚ÄúBecause the‚Ä¶eye on that.‚Äù  Now you break out in conspiracy theory.  By the way, did the US land on the moon?  Did Kennedy get shot by one man?  Now corporations do have greed, it‚Äôs part of theirs and even humans nature. The objective item going against your statement are the statics showing on average vaxxed people faired better.

‚ÄúEvery psychological‚Ä¶pause and reflect.‚Äù  Now you rant by again projecting your flaw, though I will say that both political parties share in some of this flaw.  You show you have been coerced, not looking objectively at the information, and just buying into authority.

‚ÄúWise words‚Äù  in the right context, perhaps, but what they really are are words that show you are a lemming.  I predicted and was right, I typed that quote and added Covid 19 at the end to a Google search.  First popped up was a Reddit site where an anti vaxxer was using the same argument.  I even saw it on agweb.  So you don‚Äôt even think for yourself, but you want to sound like you do.  That‚Äôs a sad part of you not thinking for yourself and just following the crowd.

‚ÄúBtw‚Ä¶‚Äù another unsubstantiated anecdote with no evidence.  And no, you didn‚Äôt see through anything, you only saw what your authority or authorities told you to see and think.

‚ÄúThink for yourself and challenge those in charge.‚Äù  I have no problem with this already.  Note how I went into a thread with just some objectivity despite the great bias and held my own.

‚ÄúIt was never ever about safety, it was about control‚Äù nice conspiracy theory you have that others have told you to think and regurgitate.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like you realize that you are giving this much evidence that you projected your own flaw onto me.  And here is where we see your lack of analysis because to say something as unsubstantiated as ‚Äúit was never about safety‚Äù given the research that shows the values of different actions, you are sadly lying to supported what you are indoctrinated to say.

Reply: @@shamoosed ‚Äúalso just because you have your back to someone doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt spread it to them.‚Äù  Another strawman by you.  When did I ever say you can‚Äôt spread it at all‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt.  All I did was point out that the attempted cutting down of the spread was related to breathing on people.  You continue to try to act like all this was supposed to prevent all spread, it wasn‚Äôt and that shows you were the one that was fooled and is still confused.

‚ÄúYou made a comment to someone earlier that you understood how aerosols work and then you made a comment to me about breathing out of that back of your head. Are you trying to move the goal posts?‚Äù  Nice childish projection of your flaw.  That‚Äôs an ‚ÄúI know you are but what am I‚Äù type response by you.  And you are trying to combine two comments on different things.  I do understand how aerosols work, I also understand how masks, social distancing, etc. were decreasing (not eliminating) the spread.  So having your back to someone does decrease spread consistent with the masks and social distancing.  You keep confusing yourself to desperately‚Ä¶what‚Ä¶win some type of point.  Sorry you continue to be disappointed.

Reply: @@shamoosed   ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you reply to what happened since January of 2021?‚Äù  I did.  It‚Äôs the post that starts with my quoting your ‚Äúokay I‚Äôll play‚Äù.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt more people wear masks?‚Äù  Nice moving the goal posts, the question is whether more people wore masks, it was whether your original statement that everyone was wearing masks, they weren‚Äôt per the study I shared.

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt there more cases?  Didn‚Äôt more people die?‚Äù  Again more moving the goal posts by you.  This does nothing to support your lie that everyone was wearing a mask.

‚ÄúI guess your argument is more people would have died if they didn‚Äôt wear their masks on the way to their tables.‚Äù  My argument is that statistically the prescribed process was not ridiculous (as I said with my first post).

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see the science on that.‚Äù  It‚Äôs logic.  You cough directly on someone vs have the cough covered by a mask (or sneezing or coughing into your inner elbow which is commonly suggested prior to COVID).  These steps don‚Äôt prevent the spread of disease but they cut down.

Reply: @@tjones5719 ok this is my last one.  I believe your argument was that the wearing of your mask on your way to the table then taking it off once seated made sense.  Whether or not you believe masks work or don‚Äôt work the rule doesn‚Äôt make sense.  You admit the mask is to slow the spread and not stop it.  You also admit that you could catch it from a nearby table or from the person you are dining with.  (Can we use my example from the restaurant bar?) So using your logic it only makes sense to keep the mask on at all times and still we can only hope to slow the spread.  A person who claims the masks don‚Äôt work would say that there is no need to wear a mask at all.  So in the end both sides should agree the mask while standing but not while sitting doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Did I win?  Did you win?  What the heck it‚Äôs 2022 we both win!!

Reply: @@shamoosed  ‚Äúok this is my last one.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs hope you don‚Äôt lie and choose to be logical for once.

‚ÄúI believe your argument was that the wearing of your mask on your way to the table then taking it off once seated made sense.‚Äù  I wonder why you couldn‚Äôt get that the first time you responded because you have continued to make my argument something it wasn‚Äôt for many posts.

‚ÄúWhether or not you believe masks work or don‚Äôt work the rule doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù  If that‚Äôs your claim then back it up or refute my support for my claim.

‚ÄúYou admit the mask is to slow the spread and not stop it.‚Äù  I think I said it would statistically reduce the spread (I don‚Äôt think I said ‚Äúslow‚Äù because that could mean different things).  I also said it wouldn‚Äôt prevent it.  So you were close but depending how you define some things you could have been more accurate.

‚ÄúYou also admit that you could catch it from a nearby table or from the person you are dining with.‚Äù  I haven‚Äôt commented on this, so no I don‚Äôt think I did admit this.  You are slowly moving toward making things up again.

‚ÄúCan we use my example from the restaurant bar?‚Äù  No because that is not the scenario we are working with, the OP said a restaurant not a bar.  Stick to the example given.

‚ÄúSo using your logic it only makes sense to keep the mask on at all times and still we can only hope to slow the spread.‚Äù  No, you once again are trying to suggest I am indicating use of the mask is for prevention.  That‚Äôs not the topic, the topic is does wearing a mask from door to table make sense (ie not ridiculous).  Why is it so hard for you to read and simply respond to what has been laid out.  You are so desperate is why.

‚ÄúA person who claims the masks don‚Äôt work would say that there is no need to wear a mask at all.‚Äù  Yes that is what a person with that view might say.

‚ÄúSo in the end both sides should agree the mask while standing but not while sitting doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù  No, because once again you moved the goal posts to focus on prevention entirely and not statistical improvement.

‚ÄúDid I win?‚Äù  No because you once again were illogical by changing what we are discussing.

‚ÄúDid you win?‚Äù  Conversations are not about winning and losing, you should learn that.  Do the points that I made stand up to your attempts, absolutely, but that isn‚Äôt winning per se.

‚ÄúWhat the heck it‚Äôs 2022 we both win!!‚Äù  No.  You represent the slow degradation of society with such refusal to listen and so much indoctrination that you aren‚Äôt as productive as a member as you should be.  That‚Äôs sad and it definitely means I don‚Äôt view this as winning.

Reply: @@shamoosed  at this point, I do think you don‚Äôt know where you went wrong, so I will be kind and help you out.

First did you ever notice and wonder why I responded to Sarah and not the OP?  It‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt really disagree with the OP.  I did however disagree with Sarah.  Why?  Because Sarah stated the process of wearing a mask to the restaurant table and then removing it made ‚Äúno sense‚Äù.  

That means she is saying there is absolutely no benefits whatsoever to be had from that prescribed process.  Absolutes, if you didn‚Äôt know, are rarely right.

So to make my case, all I had to do is convince that even the minutest of reduction in spread occurred from this process.  If I did then the process did make sense.  You could argue that it wasn‚Äôt worth the gain, or unreasonable, or other, but on that original issue I would have successfully made my point.

So is it less likely (even one hundredth of a percent) that a person would spread the virus to someone unknown to them by wearing a mask to their table?  And if you hesitate on that, what about if that person walking to the table was coughing into the mask rather than directly at a stranger with mouth uncovered would the mask have reduced the spread?  The answer to both is yes and therefore Sarah was wrong saying it made ‚Äúno sense‚Äù.

You see the mistake you made is you assumed (strawmanned really) thinking I was promoting some political view.  I wasn‚Äôt.  I was simply addressing the failure in Sarah‚Äôs logic.  It didn‚Äôt matter which side she was on, I would have pointed out the failure either way.

Reply: I thought it would be interesting to recap all the illogical people I have faced in this thread.  Most did a classic movement of the goal posts.  This happened because all my point claimed was that the masking process to the restaurant table provided some (even a microcosm) of benefit and protection (lowering the odds ever so slightly of spreading).  All of those that committed this fallacy tried to make it seem like I claimed that it prevented all transmission when I didn‚Äôt, not once, didn‚Äôt even suggest it.  So here is the list of the illogical people on this thread.

Justin W - moving the goal posts as they moved the standard to complete prevention when that isn‚Äôt what we were discussing.

barfyman 362 - both a strawman and a moving the goal posts as there was a pretending I held a position I don‚Äôt as well as changing the standard.

Judith Brandon - moving the goal posts to make the standard complete prevention when that isn‚Äôt the statement

Team Blanco - a strawman as the team pretended my position was something other than it is.  Also started with an ad hominem.

John McAeria - completely avoided what I said.  No logical fallacy, but didn‚Äôt even make a point either.

Sarah Pyke - moving the goal posts by focusing on how people were or weren‚Äôt compliant rather than my actual point

shamoosed - multiple logical fallacies but the primary one was a moving of the goal posts trying to move the standard to preventing all transmission 

K4 K - just a basic ad hominem

Ac Bower - just lack of reading comprehension and strawman by claiming something that wasn‚Äôt identified as the moving the goal posts, was the reason for the move of the goal posts

Born-Bitter - moving the goal posts acting like the standard was complete prevention of transmission which it wasn‚Äôt

mjojco - strawmanned my view prompted me to wear a mask despite me stating the opposite

11 people and not one could read or create a valid argument or base their statements on what was my claim.  That‚Äôs a pretty pronounced failure on all your parts.

‚ÄúThe aerosol he/she spoke of, is from you breathing COVID in the air, which others in the restaurant will then inhale‚Äù. You made a minor error that has a major impact, you used the verb ‚Äúwill‚Äù when you should have said ‚Äúmay‚Äù.  Just because something is in the air doesn‚Äôt mean everyone will breath it in.  

‚ÄúWhen you breath you are literally creating an aerosol‚Äù and this is the start to your strawman because quote where I have said otherwise, I haven‚Äôt, so you are ignorantly making things up thinking you wouldn‚Äôt be called out on it.

‚ÄúYour exhalation spreads everywhere‚Äù another uninformed statement of yours.  It spreads but it does not spread ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù.  If that were true and your other fallacy that everyone will breath it in would mean everyone would have gotten COVID within say the first week.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt simply stay at your table‚Äù another strawman by you, when did I say it said it stayed at your table because I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIf I can paraphrase what you said, it sounds like you are just trying to say that you are sorry for being wrong and coming off so aggressive at first. I accept your apology.

The snowflake cannot make any ground and they just want to get out trying to save face.  What they do is become totally non responsive to what the other person says, making up what the other person said in hopes that the other person says ‚Äúwell this is pointless, I type out a meaningful response and then the other person just lies about what I said, I am not wasting my time anymore.‚Äù

The problem for you is I won‚Äôt say that primarily because half the reason I comment in threads is to draw out snowflakes like you.  I study your actions, your fragile egos, your retreats.  While I would prefer an actual discussion, this is a close second to what I hope to see.

Comment: Now the question becomes: Since you realize that masking and social distancing was not helpful and our children have been forced to mask for 2 years and the liberal media and platforms such as SNL helped drive the BIG LIE how and when do we hold these fools severely accountable??

Comment: They say that comedy is all about timing. Well, SNL, you're way behind the curve on this one. You are finally saying things that the majority of us sane people have been saying for at least the last year or more.

Maybe this is SNL's backhanded way of saying, "All of you people we accused of being conspiracy theorists...you were right all along."

Comment: It was all crap. In New york we built all these hospitals and didnt even have to use them. The javit center was shutdown to use as a hospital and it was never used, and im talking about in the beginning. The navy ships were brought and they were never used. We were all lied to. Were there deaths? Sure but not the figures they gave us. Hospitals were getting extra funding for every covid case, so what did the hospitals do? They played the system and marked every death as a covid death. Were the elderly and obese dying from covid? Absolutely. Still it was one of the biggest scams played on the world.

Trying desperately to get ahead of the humor curb that ran over them and left them in the dust a long time ago? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs refreshing in a retarded sort of way, like getting an apology letter from someone who already died.

Way too into the popular, woke media to go against the tide prior to seeing how most Americans...and the world...feel now.  Too little, too late.  SNL used to be ahead of the game.  Not so much now.

A true comedian can make their jokes understood by the average Joe across the board regardless of "political affliation"..but you insist it's some secret joke just for lefties.

Reply: Also for historians there was an obsessed constituency during this time that put the health of our elderly and vulnerable at risk for their cult politics and selfishness in the name of personal freedom. Who rooted on a war mongering dictator because of his intolerance for people who are marginalized and different, who put the issue of a mask before the oppression of others. Who mocked science, who followed the random internet musings of unproven conspiracy. Who called those who smeared fecal matter on our Capital walls and beat cops to death as heros and martyrs.

Reply: @@thedude4672  I am vaccinated and I have been wearing a mask everywhere. My point is that some scientists have been questioning the veracity of the vaccine and the effectiveness of masks, and they have been demonized, ridiculed, banned from platforms, and called conspiracy theorists. But now it's OK to say that stuff?  What changed, besides the powers that be deciding it's now OK to talk about?

Comment: "We did did our best and we are going to get through this."  Yep, go ahead and forget about all the people who lost their businesses and jobs due to your irrational fear.  Forget about all the people you cut out of your lives because they refused to succumb to mindless terror and insisted on looking at actual statistics.  Forget about the hysterical people foaming at the mouth because someone in their store or elevator chose not to cover their mouths with the adult equivalent of a security blanket.  Forget about the kids whose education you interrupted for years. You were wrong about everything up and down the line, but go ahead and forgive yourselves, because you were in the middle of a "pandemic".  Just don't expect me to forget.

Reply: That‚Äôs not what the sketch is about.

Masks do work when they‚Äôre used properly and consistently, so they‚Äôre not resisting the truth. If you don‚Äôt think masks work, by all means tell your next surgeon to unmask and take their gloves off. The ineffectiveness results from inconsistent mask use, like when you have a birthday party and are masked part of the time and unmasked the rest of the time, like Kate‚Äôs character brings up. In situations like that you might as well not have worn a mask at all.

Reply: @@jenniferbenjamin2152 Surgeons historically wear gloves and masks primarily for bacteria which are FAR, FAR larger than viral particles (how much larger, well on the order of comparing Jupiter to the Sun, and you can fit a thousand Jupiters into the Sun), and there are some common classes of bacteria that are far more pathogenic and stronger than most common viruses. For example, during the Spanish Flu epidemic, it was not so much the flu virus that directly killed people, but rather the secondary pneumonia (bacterial) infections that really did people in. And that was because antibiotics as we now know and use them were not available at that time. 

  It's very much an apples to oranges comparison, and you should think more critically about things before spouting such platitudes. 

    And even the best masks are only semi effective--as long as the viral particles are encased in a larger matrix like saliva or mucous. The mask blocks the latter and not the former. Here's the funny thing about saliva though--it is made up of mostly water, and water evaporates pretty quickly in most conditions (especially dry, winter conditions inside). So once that water that is "holding/encasing" the viral particles evaporates, those particles are now free form and can easily pass back and forth through the pores of all regular masks, because the size difference is like comparing chainlinked fence (the pores of the mask) to small pebbles (the viral particles).  (Mucous on the other hand, is a much better and more permanent trapping matrix for viral particles. Its basically a sticky glue like substance that doesn't break down quickly or easily).

    I have been saying these things, and citing science research articles that support same, since the very beginning and I was just written off a "crazy, conspiracy person", and if the people didn't know me, they often assumed I was right wing, a Trump supporter, or the like, none of which is true. But I do have a very unusually high IQ and have learned to think critically and independently for myself.  I would be one of the rare people in psychological experiments like Milgram, who WOULD have rebelled and not gone along.

Reply: @@jenniferbenjamin2152 Mask used in the population don't work. The test show they work a percentage of the time against a single expositor. At best 1 out of 4 times don't. That means of you are exposed more then 4 times in a day  will get it. In a 100 day's 100% of the people will get covid in a group. They are not effective over time. I read the studies 2 years ago and knew they were not that effective. When the virus was far and few. your limited to the number of times you get exposed, Once a group of people are expose it only a matter of time. I wore a mask all the time and I got covid in June of 2020. I rarely life the house. So no they are not that effect over time.
The mask and gloves are changed between patients. To prevent cross contamination. So they know over time the PPE is not effective without changing between exporters. The public taking off and putting on the same mask for weeks is risker then not wearing a mask.
If we wore disposable mask and changed them after everyone interaction it's 1 in 4 chance you will get infected. Most of the people who were working in hospital already got covid and didn't need the vaxx. That shows you how effective the mask were. The stories of nurse having to go to work with covid some how got lost in the memory hole.

Reply: @@Based_Is_Best ‚Äã You clearly didn't understand what I said, but I don't think you were trying to understand it. Let me break it down for you. Masks are effective as a tool, since they block the major points of entry for bacteria and viruses. Surgeons wear them for the same reason, hence the analogy. If they weren't effective at all, surgeons wouldn't wear them (nobody would). They are not so effective when people (I'm assuming like you) walk around with it hanging off their face, don't bother to wash or replace their masks and don't wash their hands, and still go to parties and restaurants where they end up just taking their masks off anyway. So I wouldn't say masks have been ineffective at blocking COVID in the majority of situations, but in general they have far less effective in practice because of people who think they know better or who simply don't give a shit not using them properly, and because many states re-opened public venues that serve food (where you can't wear a mask) far too early. Go be an asshole to someone else. ‚úåÔ∏è

Reply: ‚Äã@@justinw1765 You're being quite condescending, so I'm not going to bother being nice. The analogy I used was to show that masks are not totally ineffective (when worn properly). If they were, they wouldn't be used by the medical community. Now, do ALL masks, regardless of material and thickness, block every single particle? No. This is why N95 masks exist and why people shouldn't wear mesh masks or masks with those filters on them. An N95 mask is the most effective at blocking bacteria and viruses (and all sorts of other particles) but due to the price and shortage of them a lot of people couldn't get those, so they were advised to use the next best thing, which is those thick cloth masks with inserts or the medical masks. They're less effective than the N95, but still better than going maskless. This is largely due to the fact that viruses are transmitted through the air by fluid particles (water vapor and mucus) emitted when you cough, sneeze, or even just talk. These fluid droplets are much larger, and it's these that the masks block. You should think more critically about things before spouting such nonsense (you used platitudes incorrectly).

Reply: @@jenniferbenjamin2152  N95 pores are still significantly larger than free form virus particles. Again, only effective when the viral particles are encased in a larger matrix like saliva or mucous. If they made a mask with pores small enough to completely block all viral particles, it would be rather hard to breathe out of said mask as it would lower the CFM rating quite a bit. A gas mask though, would be far more practical and effective.  Didn't see too many wearing these interestingly. 

  Definition of platitude: "a remark or statement, especially one with a moral content, that has been used too often to be interesting or thoughtful."

    The, "masks are mostly effective" statement has indeed become a platitude and often used by people who overly identify with certain groups and group think (liberal, progressive, Democrat, anti-Trumpers, etc), and motivated by moral intentions in an effort to reduce harm to others (laudable intentions, though the reasoning and logic is off).  There is lack of thought in it for one, over used for another, and definitely NOT interesting (or worthwhile to even mention) for those who think critically and holistically free of group think influences.  So yes, for me, I do very much consider it the very definition of a platitude. 

    I apologize about my earlier, somewhat condescending tone towards you, but I truly am just so fed up with the degree of lack of critical thought among the collective regarding this issue. (and now Ukraine). 

    If you haven't already, I suggest you researching deeply psychological experiments like Milgram, Stanford Prison, etc.  These will show you that the majority of people are very easy to manipulate, deceive, coerce, etc when so called "authority" becomes involved (just a man in a labcoat can be enough), or if power is dangled as a carrot.

 I already addressed this in my first reply to you, and yes, I agree with you that decent to good masks are effective at blocking the above INITIALLY. But what you and most people don't seem to think about is, what happens when viral particles in saliva (which is mostly water) experience that matrix evaporating around them, and thus freeing the viral particles to become freeform and airborne again? 

    A sneeze is often different from a cough. A sneeze often is more mucous heavy, but coughs are sometimes mostly just saliva based. Mucous is an excellent trapping matrix for viral particles, it doesn't let them go free anytime soon.  But saliva can evaporate very quickly and allow those particles to go freeform quickly. Once freeform, not even N95 masks will block these.

    No one ever told me this or pointed out it to me. It occurred to me when I was thinking critically, logically, independently, and holistically about the matter. But once explained and pointed out, it is plainer than common sense. There is no "good argument" against it. It is basic physics.

  And I haven't even brought up eyes and how eyes are an entry point for viral particles.

Nancy Pelosi - most successful stock trader in the world net worth: $114m (on salary of $223k). Top 50 members of congress net worth all over $10m. Obama net worth increased from $1.3m (as state senator salary of $60k) to $60m+. In UK my own country, our government gave out millions to close friends during the pandemic for 'emergency fast-track supplies'. Also received millions in donations from Russians. Janet Yellen (Secretary of Treasury) received $7.2m in speaking fees (and during pandemic, meaning VIDEO CALLS), including from Citadel. Recent ban on insider trading (after numerous scandals of insider trading was highlighted - going on for years let's be honest), is completely negated by the fact they can still trade mutual funds, which can mirror performance of markets. Lobbying by big business is a booming economy,  with $3.7Bn in 2021.. the list goes on and on.
Guess who owns the media? The same companies lobbying, donating and colluding with the politicians that make the laws. So the fact most of this flies under the radar is because it is so fucking corrupt people's heads would explode and would risk real political shift beyond two party systems - hence why they coerce and manipulate us in order to maintain this system. They are effectively a giant mafia organisation.
SNL is a very small part of a very big machine aimed at manipulating people to behave a certain way that benefits this system. Who funds SNL? NBC Studios. Who owns NBC? - Comcast. What does Comcast do? Lobbying and political donations $43m 2019-2020.

Surgeons use masks to protect the patient, not themselves.  Masks work in surgery because they help protect the patient from surgical-team-originated elements going into the incision site - not to guard against airborne respiratory viruses.

Masks do very little to prevent exhaled airborne viruses from dispersing in the local environment, and do even less prevent the inhalation of the airborne virus.

I, and the many others you pretentiously and ironically look down upon, were never anti-mask - just thought a lot of the policies weren‚Äôt contiguous, were sporadic, and were authoritarian without being authoritative.  Really, folks were just anti-mandate - especially when there were such large and deliberately unexplained gaps in the paltry justification for the mandate.

I‚Äôm just glad the science, despite any corresponding change in empirical data, suddenly and dramatically shifted.  It‚Äôs almost like political science randomly trumped epidemiological science.  Huh‚Ä¶ Strange..

No that‚Äôs absurd but I think they caused an artificial economic collapse. There is no reason why young people should be held on lockdown like the older and unhealthy people should. We gave out so much extra unemployment money that it was better for a lot of low skill workers to just take a 50$ pay cut to not work at all. Completely closing the economy is not the best way to respond to a pandemic. If the economy collapses then a lot of people will die also. The supply chain is extremely fucked up cuz we were paying people to stay home. At the beginning of the pandemic I was making 20/hr I could have quit my job to just chill and relax and I would only take a $100 pay cut each week. This forced lockdown has only helped big corporations and destroyed small businesses.

It‚Äôs hard to deny which part was/is all about lockdown and mandates and extremely nonsensical rules.

Reply: @@jenniferbenjamin2152 That analogy about the surgeon seems a bit far reaching. A surgeon will tell you, as I am now, that without the lengths of decontamination gone through prior to even applying that mask, the mask is useless. The amount of prep gone through before surgery is extensive and absolutely necessary. Just throwing on a mask that was in your pocket and touching it with hands that haven't been sterilized is ridiculous. Good on you for pointing out the gloves tho. I don't believe anyone pro mask has mentioned that gloves, eyewear, decontamination, or the constant disposal of masks used just once was a necessary step. Throwing on a mask more than once a day is something so anti bacterial science that it's hurts my brain to even consider. I have felt this entire time that those masks caused more infection than a six year olds birthday party ever could have.

Reply: @@justinw1765 Ok, you keep openly suggesting I am not thinking critically, which is what is so offensive. Also, do you think anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers aren‚Äôt a direct result of a hive mind? Do you think the whiny boys on this thread aren‚Äôt reinforcing each other‚Äôs beliefs, encouraging them to belief they are right and thus discouraging critical thought?  None of the comments here have even read what I‚Äôve said and thought about what it is I was actually saying. They just see ‚Äúmasks are effective,‚Äù which triggers an emotional response, and then they feel the need to try and mansplain why I‚Äôm wrong, and just try and laugh at me to cover up the fact they don‚Äôt have a better argument. I‚Äôm tired of repeating myself, so I‚Äôm not going to anymore. People only hear what they want to hear, and they love to be offended or to try and assert dominance over others. Ps. I‚Äôm politically unaffiliated specifically because I believe in evaluating policies critically, regardless of the party in which they originated. As it happens, that has actually resulted in me voting Democratic. What‚Äòs that saying about when you assume‚Ä¶? 

Also- you‚Äôre missing a critical point. Masks help prevent the spread by blocking a major  exposure pathway. Masks don‚Äôt need to be 100% effective to be a helpful tool in reducing disease transmission. If you had a house, a burglar could break in, but you don‚Äôt leave your doors and windows open to make it easier for them. Your first point about masks being effective at blocking bacteria and viruses by blocking transmission through spread of fluid particles to/from your mouth and nose is essentially what I said. This is also what the CDC has said all along (apparently you think they don‚Äôt think critically either, despite being a research org), and my very first comment was about how masks mandates in practice have not been as effective as hoped due to all of the exceptions and people not adhering to protocols or wearing masks correctly. So nobody said masks were the ultimate solution to Covid, just that they can be one effective means of reducing (not eliminating entirely) the spread of COVID.

Comment: The part about the "hesitant" *maybe* having "like, a valid......" A valid right to decide what they do with their effing bodies? If you were once condemning those who didn't fall in line and now understand their logic and recognize their rights, I implore you to remember. Use your heart and intuition so you don't become an unwitting agent for destructive energies again. üôè Turn off the news. I know this statement sounds extreme and wacky at first, but TV news is literally a propaganda tool. There are reputable alternative sources of information; you have to sift and use discernment. Try hard to make sure your thoughts are your own. We need more people whose internal bullshit meter goes off and who speak up when things like the gymnastics story in this skit happen. You are smart and you absolutely have the ability to know and feel what is right and true. Do not forget that you were manipulated into condemning people who didn't want to take a drug. It doesn't make you a bad person, but it's now your responsibility to stay awake.

"Sure"
"Why did I have to get a booster?"

Ironic because you celebrities were all for it for the longest and when people disagreed because of the ridiculousness of it all we were called crazy, etc!  You people are ALWAYS late to the game and slow to figure out what is happening right in your faces!!

If cops can be sent to jail for 20 years having mistaking grabbing a gun vs a taser, I don't see why cdc, elected politicians and school officials don't do time as well.  Many more people dies from suicide, drug abuse, physical abuse, depression..etc.

There were mask studies before this and they said the same thing. I don't know why we had to wait 2 years to reaffirm what the old studies already had said. Leftist don't care about science they just wait to be told how to think from their masters. "Right-Think".

Oh and Leftists, I hope you know your masters are just giving you "a break". They'll bust out the mandates again once the midterms are over. Can't have you being a free person and all.

Comment: Schadenfreude is taking pleasure in another's harm. Per the comment in the skit, the pro-vax crowd are more likely to experience schadenfreude, be happy when an unvaccinated person gets Covid. We've all heard it. Journalists have even said it's the right thing to do to make fun of them when an unvaxxed person gets sick or die. The unvaccinated are more likely to feel dismay that they weren't able to save a vax-injured person and his family the suffering.

Reply: @@thedude4672 I don‚Äôt think you are understanding my statement. The empirical evidence has always shown that mask mandates do nothing. This has been the case since the start of covid. That is exactly what this skit is poking fun at. Which these entertainers can do because unlike the thousands of small businesses destroyed by Covid restrictions, the entertainment industry was booming. Now everyone is seeing through the veil that most of the Covid measures did nothing. This is reflected in the poll numbers and now regulations are getting lifted all over the place, not because the science changed but because the left is losing support for their authoritarian hold on society.

Comment: Always spinning the story in hopes of convincing people they are cutting edge.  They are as dull and as pathetic as they were 2 years ago.  These people have no idea what science is.  The left hates science, they always have and they always will.   They don't believe babies inside the mother are babies, they believe a male human can be a female in a mans body.  And that is just a hint of their madness. They don't know which bathroom a man should use.  They believe a man can marry a man. They believe a woman can marry a woman.  They are lost.  Very few of them will ever repent from their moronic ways.

I work in science and studied microbiology.  Yet, people were looking at me when I was 20 feet away outside running as if I killed their puppy.

Reply: that's just the thing. People who "believe in science" don't actually think scientifically. They just believe what the Scientistic (not necessarily scientific) Priesthood tells them. In my dabbling in really difficult scientific thinking that hurts my brain, the one thing I've learned is that you never believe what ANYONE tells you. ESPECIALLY if they say that you should believe them just because they have credentials. Nature doesn't give a FUCK about credentials. Take this fact for an example of "believing the science": the earth is 4.55 billion years old. Yea. OK. So what does that mean? Does that mean when the proto-earth accumulated a mass the size of a basketball? A football field? Rhode Island? The moon? What EXACTLY does that number mean? Ask 10 people who "know" those three digits of the age of the earth to tell you what that means beyond those three digits. You'll find that most of them at the very least SEEM to think that the entire mass of Earth popped into existence in an instant, just like young earth creationists that reject the entire natural history framework. Well that was an essay. I'm bored AF

Reply: SARS-CoV-2 is far more airborne transmitted than touch/direct contact transmitted. They originally thought (or propagandized) it was also fairly touch/direct contact transmitted, but that was later contradicted by various other research studies. With that said, even the best masks, at best, are only semi effective and there are numerous reasons for that including that you can get technically get viral infections via your eyes. And masks only block viral particles when they are encased in a larger matrix (i.e. saliva or mucous), but cannot block free form viral particles because these are significantly smaller than the pores of even the best masks (like the N95's). Plus many regular masks are not tight fitting enough all around the face to be highly effective.  The only masks that are  highly effective against freeform viral particles are gas masks.

Proceeded to wipe the counter down, scan the box I was holding in the air, and then wiped the counter down again, without me ever setting it down.

I tell ya, social media has demonstrated, more than anything, that people like to bitch and moan.

Reply: This comment is ripe for blaming service industry workers who are just doing the procedures they are REQUIRED to do by the business they work for. I worked most the pandemic in cosmetics and if you can imagine it was a nightmare to try and sanitize, and to deal with customers who wouldn‚Äôt wear masks. Not because I particularly had a problem with someone not wanting to wear one, but there were times I was told we would be fired on the spot if we were caught not enforcing the mask policy. Not to mention people who talk a lot like some of y‚Äôall I see in the replies who think they‚Äôre real big brains who think for themselves who would go out of their way to be intentionally disrespectful or abusive. Y‚Äôall act like it‚Äôs those workers personally making the call to deny you service or what have you when it‚Äôs rarely ever the case. If I had a dime for everytime I had someone intentionally cough on me, yell at me, or have a full blown meltdown like a toddler because I offered them a mask to wear while it took 10 minutes maybe for them to get what they want and get out, I would be RICH.

Did you ever consider that the handing the mask was not for protection that instance but reinforcing the rules so the customer (and friends and family of the customer) would know they were serious so the next dozen plus times they came through the drive thru they would have on a mask.

‚ÄúFinding irony and humor in a situation doesn't mean the person can't understand the reasoning of the people involved.‚Äù  Except we aren‚Äôt talking about a skit, nor irony and humor.  You again are deflecting.  The person themselves in their post indicate they don‚Äôt understand the legitimate reason someone would do what they did.

‚ÄúI miss the days when we all could laugh together at funny shows without our enjoyment being seen as a political statement or something.‚Äù  It seems like your need to deflect and avoid what I actually said is part of the problem you are talking about.  You are part of the problem.

‚ÄúMaybe you're reading too much into the fact that Andrew enjoyed the skit and you're taking needless offense over it.‚Äù  A number of lies here by you.  First Andrew‚Äôs comment wasn‚Äôt about the skit.  Second Andrew‚Äôs comment wasn‚Äôt about enjoying the skit (it‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt even watch the video to claim this).  Third I showed no offense, rather it was Andrew that showed offense by the baristas actions (so you are projecting someone else‚Äôs flaw onto me).

All of this deflecting was pretty humiliating for you.  If you try again, I hope you slow down and try to do better.  It‚Äôs your type of response that shows the painful close minded and desperate attempt to keep your views uninformed.

First your claim that the masks don‚Äôt work is moving the goal posts.

Second you would have to source where the general populous thought politicians were scientists because I did not hear this from the populace.  Third because COVID was new and unique, I would need to see your source of the past forty year research that applied to COVID.

Reply: @@zchris87v I would like to address your post on two ways.

The first is from a quality standard perspective.  Maybe you are not familiar with ISO standards but the gist of them is that you create a quality process and then you follow that process every time.  So in your story, a busy retailer, the cashier and other patrons are not going to notice - did that person touch the counter, did they set something down temporarily, etc. Because of this, the process likely was ‚Äúwipe down the counter after every customer‚Äù.  And even if the cashier noticed you didn‚Äôt touch or set anything down, the people behind you in line likely didn‚Äôt notice and therefore the wiping down serves a purpose for them as well.  You being upset by this doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.

I toured a factory making laptop batteries.  There was a step in the process where the very next person in the facility would do a double check of the components being placed in the right location using a template cut out.  Now that person could lull themselves into thinking ‚Äúit looks right, why do I have to check‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just saw Jane install these components, she knows what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing, why do I need to check‚Äù.  But they still do it because there is no acceptance of error.

I will give another analogy in the retail space.  I worked in a convenience store and has a bartenders license to sell alcohol.  Now back in those days, stings would happen to see if the police could catching you selling to an underaged person.  The rule at the time was you selected who you would card and you could offend someone by asking for an ID even if they were only 25.  My thought at the time was ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the rule we card everyone‚Äù. Sure you are checking more people then you needed to, but you also removed the chance for error from not carding someone.  You also cut down on the upset by rational customers who would know that is the rule.  Now since then we have moved closer to that in places I shop.

So your story makes you, not the cashier, look irrational.

The other way of addressing your story is I don‚Äôt think you told the whole truth based on what you said.  I am familiar with Kohls and most Kohl‚Äôs checkouts have a place for the person actively being checked out but also a counter for the person next in line.  I doubt if this was the setup that you wouldn‚Äôt have set the Keurig down on the counter.  Even if this wasn‚Äôt the setup, your statement that you were shouted at suggests that you already had set down the Keurig before the cashier could wipe down.  So I just don‚Äôt think you told the whole story.

Families were destroyed... all because mask and vaccine mandates and shaming by assholes like YOU, Saturday Night Live.  You did a lot of shaming over the past year.  Yet all the data was available from the CDC - they hid it as best they could, but it was always THERE for ANYONE TO FIND!   You owe EVERYONE AN APOLOGY, SNL.

People, the best thing you can do for the world is stop watching, don't watch their news or movies or shows.  Find better things to do with your time than listening to what rich people think you should think.

Comment: - CDC studied August 2021 500 person delta outbreak. 273 of 500 were faxinated. 1) We know faxination has not prevented majority infection and spread. 
- 2022 look at all infections after the start of mask mandates. Safe to say the majority of all infections occurred in individuals that participated in local mask mandates. This fits my personal witness experience. Im sure it fits yours as well. 2) mask mandates have not prevented majority infection and spread.

Although it doesn‚Äôt help all the people who lost their jobs due to political motivated vaccine mandates, soldiers dishonorably discharged for not getting the vaccine, and the small businesses that now will be forever closed.

Comment: SNL is at its awkward worst when it placates the over-sensitivity of its young audience.  I'm sure such dinners were trying for those who put religious faith in all the COVID response policies.  This skit reminded me of the one where a bunch of young people gathered to watch Hillary win the election- and the joke was how distraught they all became.  I'm sure that sort of thing happened...but peoples' oversensitivity has gotten pretty un-funny, to be honest.

Reply: @@snakeplissken9540 A bit hyperbolic, but not an inaccurate association.  

Not to say democrats were/are Nazis, but the bit about masks outwardly showing your allegiance similar to the way other historical forms of outwardly showing allegiance has substance.

Though, of course, many dispassionate people just wore them because they were told they had to, were told the masks helped more than they actually did, and thought they were helping to protect themselves and others - and wearing them as a badge of allegiance wasn‚Äôt part of their calculus.

Of course, for some, wearing the mask was actually  more  about showing allegiance than any health benefits they thought could possibly be derived from wearing a mask. 

It‚Äôs all a bit crazy but the truth almost always works it‚Äôs way out in the end - one way or another.  Just wish society would allow the truth to come out more quickly and in a more efficient, less decisive way.

Reply: @@thedude4672 I am going to disagree with you. I have family in the medical field, I have worked in drug research, and read medical journals on the daily. 
When I warned people about COVID in Jan 2020 it was the liberals who called me a dooms dayer. When I showed them the data on cloth masks in April 2020 I was called a covid denier. Fall of 2020 I told people that it's great we can look for a vax and liberals told me I am not taking a Trump vaccine. Biden becomes president and they become militant on the same vaccine and yelling about people who don't have the vaccine need to be forced or lose their job. Even someone like me who medically can't take it due to chronic anemia and have been hospitalized for taking a flu vaccine due to complications of my chronic Illness and the doctors say the covid vaccine would be no different. I had to risk it to be a good citizen even though it didn't matter I would take up a hospital bed.  
Sure there were annoying conservatives but there are way less of them and they aren't too good at following Trump because Trump still supports the vaccine. Most conservatives I know are vaccinated and promote the vaccine but are not militant about it and you can talk to them without people getting overly emotional. 
I am an independent but I am frustrated by how many liberals are acting and moral grandstanding when they can't even bother to actually follow the science and stay informed. They will just repeat what other liberals are saying without bothering to do their own research or search for the truth.

That is how the scientific process works. Nothing "changes." It evolves as we perform more research. If you can't read a study from top to bottom and assess its methodologies, then you have no idea what you're talking about. If you trust a plumber with your pipes and a mechanic with your car, trust a scientist with your fucking scientific research.

Comment: As someone who loved masks because I didn't have to deal with people's breath, saved a lot on makeup, and didn't have to deal with people's spit while they were talking... Im still all about masks. 

Side note: I got covid recently and when I went to get a work note... I found that doctors no longer put Covid down on as the reason for being off work. They only put down the main symptom. In my city they don't count you as a positive covid case if your not hospitalized. Hence my county going maskless over a year ago

Reply: I never understood that.  It made zero sense to keep people from enjoying fresh air, getting vitamin D and ventilation. Exercise also helps the immune system.  As long as people distance (which they can do outside), it was so much safer than being stuck inside. They also didn't allow reusable bags or reusable cups for coffee.  It's so wasteful.  I'm also annoyed at people buying giant gas cars instead of public transit.  More pollution means more future pandemics, so people didn't learn anything.

Comment: SNL has sadly become such a garbage show.  How are people who have lost their jobs over the vax/mask issue supposed to feel about this sketch?  Is this like a quasi-apology for ostracizing a large number of people for having vax hesitations and questioning whether masks mandates actually do anything?  Such a pile of crap.

I lost several contracts because I didn't think sharing medical information about my employees was appropriate. And now people are just like "Whoopsie" 

F' SNL and F' all the Karen's and Neil's out there. Us independent voters aren't fooled by the Democratic establishment. COVID went away when BLM was smashing up city, then it came back, now it goes away because of a war in Europe, and as soon as it's over there'll be another variant.

Reply: @@MimiB1974 nothing wrong with reasonable precautions

most people didn‚Äôt balk at the precautions 

it was when power-tripping authoritarian politicians started taking the precautions to the extreme and mandating draconian measures that went beyond the hypothesized science of the time that people started rightfully taking exception to things 

the biggest issue was the ignorant and spiteful labeling of people, who, in the end, weren‚Äôt wrong

that, and the fact that conversations about the issues weren‚Äôt even allowed to be had

the funniest thing about this skit is watching the actors acting out how horrible and hard it is to swallow their massive black pills 

hopefully some lessons have been learned from all this craziness 

maybe those who slandered others during the mid-phases of the past two years will look introspectively and with some self awareness, learn, grow, and be better for it - would be nice, but the jaded part of me knows that‚Äôs a bridge too far for most

Reply: @@skdewolf7606 Glad you appreciate that - more people need to.

Liberalism, conservatism, and populism in roughly equal proportions are good and healthy - keeps things sensible and based while still moving forward.

Marxist leftist-authoritarianism and extreme-right fanaticism and the deranged spin-off ideologies they spawn need to be thoroughly rooted out for the scourges they are.

Hopefully the leftist hyperbolic rhetoric will begin to cool down and with it the conservative response; and sane, centrist, moderate stability (minus the swampy bureaucratic inaction) can get this county back on track.

Take care out there.

Comment: It's a funny skit, but it's sad that we were culturally forbidden from questioning anything about the mandates on the masks or vaccinations, especially as evidence continues to surface further bolstering concerns that were voiced. People were treated as cultural pariahs, socially ex-communicated for even posing the question because the potential answers created potential cognitive dissonance.
The COVID crisis has just further shaken my faith in the government and the nature of humanity.

It‚Äôs sad how so many people fell in line like sheep. Anyways on Covid hospital stays, if you went in for a broken arm, a bad appendix ect and you tested positive for Covid it was considered a Covid hospital stay.  SNL SUCKS!!!!

Comment: As a scientist and engineer, I find it very offensive that people don't know that Science is meant to be disproved. In fact, all scientific hypothesis, you must state how it can be disproved, in order to test the hypothesis.  Science is not settled law, Newtons Laws vs Quantum Physics, the Wave Particle duality, Dark Matter are all examples of this.

Comment: OK there was some odd and useless stuff that went on during the pandemic but science does change when it is facing a new disease and masks do work. Look at all the medical professionals including me who forever have had to take care of patients with respiratory diseases and kept safe with a mask and hand washing etc. But for groups that wore cloth masks and often did not wear them correctly and did not wear them in small groups of friends and relatives of course they didn‚Äôt work. I love that SNL tries to make fun of liberals too but with 2,000 people a day still dying it is hard to find the humor. üò•

Comment: It's truly amazing how many people go through life with complete and utter gullibility. Unquestioningly following orders and commands, decreed upon them by monsters that refer to themselves as elite. 

These simple people believe wholeheartedly, that these monsters have their best interest in mind. Unwilling to see that the these monsters actual goal is to control them and every aspect their lives.

But should the truth come out that they've been lied to and manipulated, that their trust betrayed, they reach exiestential crisis. 

And what being worse, when they realize they've enforced the monsters insanity by scolding, belittling and cursing those who tried to warn them...


All they now do is awkwardly laugh...

Every free thinking American knew all of the "information" in this skit. The fact that talking about any of this information would be a "taboo" dinner convo just shows how sheepish these people really are. Horrible politically correct writing. If you want some actual comedy go to KILL TONY on YouTube every Monday night.

Comment: Sure guys. If you hadn't made all those "ivermectin is stupid conspiracy theory horse medicine" jokes, and shamed anyone who disagreed with you, and advocated anyone who was against government mandates (which does NOT make someone anti-science or anti-vax as you kept claiming. The government mandating anything medical is wrong, none of their business, and they can F off about it : p) getting in trouble or losing their jobs....then maybe this would be more well received.

To be clear I am very surprised that they even did this skit, and it's by far the closest the mainstream media will come to admitting they were wrong, and that it was bad to shame and go after everyone who has a different opinion. I *do* appreciate them doing it, I wish there were more things like this. But they're still part of a worldwide network of a-holes calling everyone with differing opinions nazi's

Still, good on ya. Mulaney's funny, glad you had him on either way

Reply: exactly.  The problem with this skit is a) 2 years too late and b) they lacked the cajones to actually take much of a stance on any of it.  By poking fun at *all* of it, and lying about the efficacy of the injections, the skit actually has no useful purpose at all.

Comment: Majority voting Westerners (who controls what the Media, Academia, and politicians will genuflect to) basically impoverished the world to make themselves feel safe.  I'm imagining the meat dumpster divers supplying food to the poverty stricken ghetto in Luzon for instance, being told they had to get vaccinated so their immune systems can fight Covid because of course if westerners (who die when they sip from the wrong glass at any third world country) can't beat Covid, the dumpster divers are too fragile to face. People have to give up what meager livelihood they can to keep the "world" SAFE. So I guess the poverty stricken ghettos will just have to starve. That goes for all other services, what little they have of it.  It's disappointing to realize that the vast majority of western academia, whose boots people in third world countries are happy to lick clean for the mighty $$$$ haven't been to any of the nontourist areas and crucifying their colleagues who tell them how asinine these power trippings are. Westerners have plundered the vast majority of these countries and just like their predecessors, modern westerners never even batted an eyelash before summarily sinking their economies again. The media keep on praising these "policy makers". You think their starving kids getting half a cup of rice for their sacrifice to western vanity will get to tell Greta "how dare you?". Or is that reserved for western posh kids? Not that they will have a voice.  It will take these poor saps centuries to recover if ever from the Imperialist age, what's a couple more decades of poverty for "safety", right? After all westerners knows best. (Yes, that's sarcasm).

Comment: This is not funny or cleaver. This just shows you how dumb celebrities the SNL cast and Writers and the democrat party really is. 
The right and the center has been saying this for 2 years and now it is only acceptable to say when Biden desperately needs a win at the state of the union. 
He did not crush the virus, he made literally everything worse in regards to COVID +++  

SNL do yourself a favor and realize you are not a wing of the democrat party. You do not have to spread their propaganda. 
Do you remember 2008 when guests from all sides of the political world came on?
Do you remember 2016 when trump hosted? Do you remember how freeing it was before you turned into democrat puppets?

Reply: I laughed at this, but masks absolutely worked and still do. I used to get the flu every year despite getting the flu vaccine.  Firstly, the flu vaccine worked because although I usually still got the flu, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as severe nor did it last as long as before I was vaccinated. But, once I started wearing the mask, I didn‚Äôt get the flu NOT ONCE since the pandemic. The only difference? Masks & staying out of crowds.. Anti-maskers were wrong then & they‚Äôre still wrong today. Wearing the mask protects everyone around you. And, if everyone wears the mask, we‚Äôre all protected.

Comment: At a virtual press conference held by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Dec. 28, 2020, WHO officials warned there is no guarantee that COVID-19 vaccines will prevent people from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and transmitting it to other people.1 In a New Year‚Äôs Day interview with Newsweek, Anthony Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), reinforced the WHO‚Äôs admission that health officials do not know if COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection or if people can spread the virus to others after getting vaccinated.2 According to U.S. and WHO health officials, vaccinated persons still need to mask and social distance because they could be able to spread the new coronavirus to others without knowing it

It's not as if these people remained silent or indifferent about the situation. Instead, they actively engaged in harassment, not jokes. They genuinely supported the culture of going after people's jobs and reputations, so they're not allowed to play innocent in a skit.

If an idea dies out because it lacks merit when debated, good.

Ideas, perspectives, etcetera should not be smothered, dismissed, suppressed, cancelled, censored simply because those who have the power to do that want to do so in order to avoid debating a topic based on the merits (or lack thereof) of the idea or stance.

Reply: @@Based_Is_Best What you and I have to realize is that these platforms do not have the duty to inform. They dont have the duty to spread the truth.  They are a business.  Same applies for main stream media. They can filter out any speech they dont deem good for business.  2 months ago i could not be antimask. Today they "allow" my rhetoric.

Reply: @@Chuck-yt7iq This is why direct, meaningful competition to these platforms is so critical to strive for.

Reply: @@Based_Is_Best The censorship is general. Not just online.  I am now being criticized for asking why we didnt enforce Misnk to avoid war with crazy ass Putin.  We fed the ukranian to the dogs.  And cannot reach inside the cage to help him.That does not sit well with most now.  I recall back in April of 2020 when I told people that Italy, China and USA counts showed that 85% of covid deaths were in those 65 and over.  That we needed to tend to them and not lock down society.  85% people were in favor of such measures.  Censorship of the 49% or whatever the minority will keep going.  I want to blame millennials and centennials but it is a general problem.  Critical thinking is all but gone.

Make no mistake, YouTube comments are not reflective of reality, and those fools are trying to normalize their stance by pretending to care. When they say they don't care about anothers responsibility, or that they didn't sign a social contract, they are showing you how they actually think. They are not empathetic to the real people who actually suffered (like kids whose schooling was drastically affected by this) They want you to ultimately conclude they are correct, and that the conspiracy is real.

So, they wouldn‚Äôt do the stent procedure because ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù. My father in law with cancer was sent home 3x for a procedure because COVID has made many hospitals basically lazy and ineffective. My neighbor now has neck cancer and likely won‚Äôt make it because a virtual medical appointment through a computer screen and NO hands on decided it was neck pain. Many people have died because of COVID protocols impacting quality of care‚Ä¶.and it absolutely has NOTHING to do with too many COVID patients in hospital beds. As someone who worked in healthcare and have family members still working in healthcare, it has been sad to me to see so many staff okay with the declining quality care, partly because it makes their job easier. As a doctor, if you can sit behind a computer screen and make the same money, and not have to ever put a hand on a patient, why not? Many will gladly rationalize it. My son recently had his doctor call to switch the appointment to virtual because of ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù, and I canceled it. They later called back and offered in person. Until it hits the pocket book, this will continue. Just because healthcare is supposed to be a ‚Äúhelping‚Äù industry‚Ä¶don‚Äôt expect many hospital and medical systems haven‚Äôt taken advantage of COVID, even down to the staff.

Your "name calling" of your friends at the end of your comment was divisive and would suggest that your position on this topic was more important to you then keeping your friendships.JMHO.

Comment: wow, this is so hilarious but I thought it was much funnier and comedic when LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE SAID THE EXACT SAME THING A YEAR AGO. The strained and comfortable recoils at the mention that the leftist "MAYBE" were wrong is the literal embodiment of how it pains the elites and con artist government officials to admit they were wrong and this is how they laugh it off when literally thousands lost their jobs. So yes, really funny. so glad you can just laugh it off now. This really had my sides splitting.

Reply: salem witch trials and taking precautions to try to prevent harm to others are two very different things‚Ä¶..like even if the masks are proven less effective than we thought at least it was an attempt to do good that really didn‚Äôt harm anyone, it just made people whine about a piece of cloth. i often just wear mine now when i don‚Äôt wanna do my makeup or when i look like a scrub and wanna pop into the grocery store lol, i like how socially that‚Äôs acceptable now.

plus when consistently used (aka not with the weird indoor dining half-measure bullshit, like actually adhering to real masking policies like in a hospital) masks are proven to greatly lower infection rates, to the point that several flu variants have died out. people as a whole from day to day are just too inconsistent to prevent diseases that have evolved to spread easily, and/or they are often too headstrong to accept any kind of mandate they feel like they didn‚Äôt personally choose (even tho there are a lot of things we think we ‚Äúchoose‚Äù that are really predetermined for us by social and historical precedent). so i think laws that say ‚Äúhey do this harmless thing for a while so that we may be able to keep people safe, we don‚Äôt know much about it yet but it‚Äôs better to be proactive instead of waiting for a bunch of people to get hurt‚Äù is not comparable to the salem witch trials. one is trying to save people from death, the other is trying to condemn people to death. regardless of the effectiveness of measures taken for covid, at least they were implemented in good faith.

Comment: You all should have done this back WHEN IT ACTUALLY MATTERED.  Instead, you participated in the whole mocking, shaming, degrading anyone who stated the obvious fact that masks never prevented the spread of covid, and that the vaccines dont necessarily work, and that mandates are unconstitutional.  You all are part of the reason that people lost their jobs, their lives and that this crap is still going on.  So thanks for nothing.  The people who dared to say this back when it actually mattered have been effectively ruined by people like you.

I see you are doing it now that dems have come out in support of removing mask mandates. The science hasn't change, but because elections are coming up, you want to make sure people try to see dems in a different light. Good luck with that.

Comment: in case you aren't aware, THIS is how the mainstream propaganda machine attempts to SLOWLY back off the lies and hype and fearmongering, and allow just a LITTLE truth to come in and be normalized.  they know they've totally screwed up the psyches of so many Americans, and they can't do a 180 over night, but that is the goal.  and not for benevolent reasons, it's not like they realized all their measures and mandates and drugs were BS, they always knew that, but for other reasons, political and economic chief among them, they have to slowly nudge the covid-crazy public back into accepting a return to some kind of normalcy.  all the things they were tip-toeing around, are not only 100% true, but they don't even go far enough.  they screwed this country, and the world, over, for a reason, and covid was not the reason, it was the means to an end, it was their opportunity to not let a good crisis go to waste.  now, after destroying small businesses, ruining countless lives, making people lose their jobs, psychologically and emotionally hurting people especially children, they want us to just laugh about it and forget it ever happened and go back to normal.

Comment: This is infuriating. People like the cast of SNL, and liberals around the country made people's lives a living hell. Real people lost their job, businesses and family and friends over these ridiculous mandates. But now that the Democrats claim the science has changed (which it didn't) you now think it's safe to talk about it. Comedy is supposed to be edgy, while pointing out uncomfortable truths... However, SNL decided to wait until it was safe. This skit would have been funny a year ago, when half the country was pointing all of this out. Let's not forget the names we were called such as science deniers and anti-vaxxers, simply for stating the things that you guys are stating in this skit... And people on SNL were the ones mocking us. So go ahead, try and be funny now that you know it's safe to do so. But the only joke I see is each and every one of you performing this skit.
Oh, and the people in the comment section praising this skit, you have some nerve. The skit was about people just like you. You are the ones hysterical, and treating everybody else like less than human because we wouldn't go along with these nonsensical mandates.

Comment: Wow actually refreshing they did something like this. I'm sure I'll get annihilated in the comments for this, but I chose to not be vaccinated, got covid this winter at a camp, (along with dozens of other fully vaccinated and boosted people) and it was basically a cold for me. I quarantined a whole 14 days and didn't leave my apartment to make sure there was no chance of anyone else getting it. But I am made out to be a villain for this choice which is sad.

Reply: You're good.  You're not alone on this.  I've been looking at job postings in other cities all day... you can probably guess why.  I chose not to get the vaccine either and I was the only one of my friends who didn't.  So now they've more or less ostracized me and one person is even calling me all kinds of names, it's really sad.  Probably made me feel more "sick" than the virus (or vaccine) ever could.  Although,  I don't know if I can say that for sure, because I never actually got infected.  No asymptomatic cases either (I tested every week for work... until fired).  So, remember, the hysteria is real.  If you know you didn't harm anyone, burden the hospital, spread it, or die, your adversaries are going to have to come around if they haven't completely blocked off their conscience.  Now you even have immunity, plus don't have to worry about any unknown vaccine issues, however unlikely.

Comment: Fascinating. And this is one of the most progressive shows on U.S. TV? Yet, I think it's nice to allow Trump to write a SNL sketch. Very First Amendment. Although it does beg the question: What exactly is their agenda? I guess the rumor that SNL was acquired by Breitbart may be true after all. (Oh, and not wearing MAGA caps was a missed opportunity.)

Reply: The left and the right are BOTH wrong. The extremism and fear on the left is wrong and as we see in this sketch is really just virtue signaling at this point. Saying that masks and testing and shots did nothing is also just plain wrong. 

If we hadn't done any of it things would be a lot worse, but the mass hysteria has led some to think "fuck it" and just not care, and others to be so overcautious that they STILL have not seen their family and friends and are living in isolation for 2 years now, or have Children's birthday parties where they wear masks for some of it and not while eating in close quarters. All of it is dumb. 

Let's hope it stays gone.

Moving to NY from texas where there's beautiful lit back porch dining spaces at restaurants to the tiny booths they built out on the street with constant traffic here was a far cry from a restaurant experience. That said it's better than nothing and I hope they keep them.

I guess saved THEMSELVES from a speech impediment at 50...or not smelling their own breath OH FOR SHAME! Can't do that!! lol not. Length of exposure to other people , especially those who poopooed covid in the 1st place( remember them?) Also helped. Do a skit on that. Too hard?

SNL has become as big a shill for our incompetent gov't as CNN and MSNBC.  Only less funny.  
They went from finger on the pulse to boot on the neck as far as comedy goes.

Comment: It's literally 100% thanks to rich coastal elites like you for causing the politicization and societal polarization of this whole thing, ensuring that people doing actual independent research (i.e. what science actually is) were ostracized, jobless, unable to pursue life liberty and property, and alienated from their family, friends and colleagues.

This is you trying to pivot, in the cringeiest of ways mind you, to the moderate position when you have spent the last two years going full bore into biomedical fascism.

Just look at the difference in childhood development milestones. One of many examples of which is the CDC quietly delaying major developmental milestones in children, masks have caused a roughly 300% increase in delayed speech development in young kids 

If this is a just world we will never forget what you did. Not just to us, but especially to our children. Disgusting, the lack of accountability

Comment: How does science change? Lol that‚Äôs literally how science works. It changes when more evidence comes out. That‚Äôs what makes it reliable, because we are using the best, latest evidence to support the findings. Constant testing, data gathering, comparing, exchanging viewpoints via peer review, etc... The professionals are all we have to rely on. The people that put in the work, went to school and professed for decades in the subject(s). That‚Äôs why/how science changes, lol.

Reply: So public policy should change daily every time a new (usually non) scientific theory is floated? Oh ok. Did anyone test the efficacy of random cheap and  mass produced masks (imported from overseas no less) before blanket mandates. Nor a disposal process/method that is hygienic and environmentally sound  implemented? Yeah I think not. It was an obedience ritual.  Now we we all have to deal with the repercussions of all this psychological torture and refuse. Can‚Äôt wait for the Sarah maclaclan  PSAs of sad turtles ,seals and dolphins suffocating in masks. What  a joke

Reply: This might be true for vaccines. At first we thought they stopped transmission, but now we know that's not true at all.

But it's never been true for masks, period. The CDC's own study from 2015 concluded that masks do not stop the spread of the flu, so obviously they were going to do nothing for covid. They knew this all along.

Because all of them have been caught maskless at baseball games and restaurants, they are happily living their lives lmao. the only ones they have to were masks are the peasants like us

Not the first time SNL included us over the years as the opening and closing of a sketch (we remember a sketch with Will Ferrell that took place in a restuarant that also used our building) , but always fun seeing us as part of your fantastic show!  Here is a little history on the building, located in Downtown Santa Ana, CA and built in 1924 - http://www.grandcentralartcenter.com/history-new/

Comment: Snl has been... in a sad state recently but this is a good sketch.  Comedy should push boundaries on all topics.  It relieves the tension and helps eachother understand others opinions. 

They perfectly capture the stigma of questioning mask mandates and the current toxic environment of casual discussion of contentious issues.

Reply: I think its a absolutely disgusting 180 pivot, because they are mocking the box that they created, put us all in, and locked for 2 whole years. They were an active part of ruining peoples lives and shaming anyone who had these views LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. Its most obviously a move in preparation for the elections to make it seem like their daddy democrats did shit and didn't make everyones lives miserable. Completely hypocritical, absolutely sickening, tone deaf and pathetic. SNL has killed itself.

Comment: ‚ÄãThe whole skit is about saying we did our best but we got through it. Nothing else to see here. Move along.  Move along. But the authorities need to be held accountable.  What about children who did not learn how to speak properly because of masks.  What about children who fell behind in scholastics. What about people who lost their jobs and retirement or could not get hired. What about people who lost their businesses that got shut down.  It is not OK.   The worst will be the problems from the vax.

Comment: Does this mean that even the leftists who watch SNL can all agree 1) the things they did like lockdowns did not help. 2) Masks had little to no effect on covid. 3) Those who were hesitant to get vaxxed had valid and understandable reasons. 4) It was and is over zealous to condemn and demonize people who are not vaxxed or who did not get boosters. 5) It was wrong to breakup or hurt relationships with friends and family over whether they were vaxxed. 6) No one should have or should lose a job over whether they were vaxxed. Yet thousands of people have been victimized that way.  7) The testing did no good i.e. the UK did more testing but had more covid. 8) The science does not change and it is not a good excuse for making mistakes for the CDC to say "the science changed." That is no excuse. 9) It was stupid and ineffective to have outdoor dining by building restaurants in the street and on sidewalks. 10) It was stupid and ineffective to have school children wear masks while exercising but not immediately after while eating. 11) No one ever needed masks. That means little children who did not learn to speak properly were disadvantaged for no reason. 12) It is wrong to feel happy when an unvaxxed person gets sick with covid. 13) Every one should have been washing their hands and still should.  14) We can not let the authorities off the hook by just saying they did their best and we got through it. They need to be held accountable. We have been taken for fools and greatly burdened.

Reply: Reading the letter that the think tank sent to the Biden administration is pretty entertaining. "Democrats need to stop talking about covid being the end of the world and let people know it's okay to live normal life." Yeah, okay. Normal people who aren't NPC midwits have been doing that for a while. But at least SNL got the message loud and clear.

It will be real interesting to see how these people behave now as they run around spitting conspiracy theories on how they were right all along and the rest of the world just needed to hear their opinion lol. They just took the masks off in schools in Ohio, I have a teacher for a wife who brings home everything that K through five ends up with. If the CDC is still alive maybe they‚Äôll look into that group lol.

Reply: I think the most important thing is that we get everybody laughing about it so everyone forgets about it before the midterm elections. (Seriously one of the most powerful ways to influence people's perception is to wrap the thought change you are trying to project within humor, because people drop their defenses when they're laughing)

Reply: You laugh at the elites just washing their hands of social responsibility for the past two years of societal oppression, drug overdoses, losses of homes and negative developmental impact of children when the entire time they castigated those (who held the same opinions in this sketch from "two weeks to slow the spread") as anti science? Shame on you and shame on them

Comment: I think this skit is sad. This represents the lack of conversation we are/were able to have with one another. So sad - leading to the lack of proper handling (no matter what you think it might be) of the pandemic. The politicization of the matter made this skit - not a skit but an actually reality.

Humor is welcomed, but only because this has been no laughing matter. Some people in power need to be brought to account.

Comment: So were all just gonna say "aww shucks you got me" now that the ministry of yuk yuk says it's ok to joke about the largest fear campaign in modern history, which resulted in massive human rights violations at a global scale? I'd prefer some accountability. Like, somebody get fired or go to jail or something.

Comment: HyperNormalization:

The word hypernormalization was coined by Alexei Yurchak, a professor of anthropology who was born in Leningrad and later went to teach in the United States. He introduced the word in his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (2006), which describes paradoxes of Soviet life during the 1970s and 1980s.  He says that everyone in the Soviet Union knew the system was failing, but no one could imagine an alternative to the status quo, and politicians and citizens alike were resigned to maintaining the pretense of a functioning society.  Over time, this delusion became a self-fulfilling prophecy and the fakeness was accepted by everyone as real, an effect that Yurchak termed hypernormalisation.

Comment: Such an amazing insight into how upper middle class libs think. When you‚Äôre not a complete drone who looks to CNN for the green light as to what you‚Äôre allowed to talk about you‚Äôd have had these conversations 2 years ago. Maybe then- if we hadn‚Äôt suppressed discourse we wouldn‚Äôt have had to go through 2 years of insanity. Maybe then people wouldn‚Äôt have had their lives put on hold, their ability to make a living impeded upon, their own bodily autonomy assaulted. Now they realize they fucked up and they‚Äôre just laughing it off. ‚ÄúOops! I guess we were wrong üòù‚Äù

Comment: I hate the "science changed" comment though. The science didn't change. The available data did. That is how science works. If it didn't, we would still be trying to cure diseases with leaches. Meanwhile, I work for a well known university which is also known for its medical school/hospital (I work in the physics department) and we still have a mask mandate even though nearly 100% of students and staff are vaccinated. But, the city it is in still has an order in place too and has been more strict about it than other cities.

Comment: Wasn't just the masks we find out didn't work. It was also the washing down walls, doors with bleach. The plexiglass  barriers, constant hand washing, the entire country has been taken on this wild ride by Fauci and the " experts" that destroyed our economy and brought us inflation etc.

Reply: I‚Äôve heard (multiple) doctors say the vax was less than 1% effective against original strain, 0% effective against delta & negatively effective against omicron (meaning the immune response of the vaccinated actually harmed more vaxxed than unvaxxed at that point). As data continues to come out, we‚Äôll learn these shots always did more harm than good. I‚Äôve been the ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù who‚Äôs right 18 months later for 2 years or longer. Give this 18 months! Those shots are BAD NEWS!

Haha I mean they‚Äôre joking because yes masks WERE VERY MUCH NEEDED but they should have been N95 from the start (obviously not possible as frontline workers needed them but something‚Äôs better than nothing) to help prevent what was an extremely deadly virus for a lot of us‚Äîwhich spread via AIR BORNE MOLECULES from orifice to orifice‚Ä¶..I mean, do y‚Äôall really not see that YOU are the comedy in action, by questioning our use of masks whilst hundreds of thousands of Americans were dying (including a good amount of the ‚Äúfully vaxxed‚Äù fyi) with no signs of it stopping!!!! Thanks the LAWD for omicron, though it‚Äôs still not to be taken lightly but at least it‚Äôs not on a mass murdering spree. ANYYYYWAYS they‚Äôre making fun of the people who are like omGEEEE did we REALLY have to be SODAMN INCONVENIENCED to be asked to wear MASKS to prevent the pandemic virus from spreading and like ARE THEY REALLY MAKING A JOKE LYKE THIS WHILE THERE ARE (gasp) MASSSSKEDüò• PEOPLE CRAMMED LIKE SARDIMES IN THE AUDIENCE?!? 
The point was to show how NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN FOUR WALLS, THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE SCRUTINIZED AND MAKE FOES OF FORMER FRIENDS hahahaha. I mean it apparently happened like crazy which I can‚Äôt understand, but talking about it is this BIG SECRET THING that literally all of us are thinking about but hesitate to get a read on others‚Äô thoughts, and then some people just can‚Äôt help themselves blah blah hopefully you get it by now and why the skit was actually funny.

More importantly for those of you actually making this political and arguing about masks (REALLY? Here?!)‚Äî keep in mind that not everyone is so forrrrtunate as to feel like we can be social buttz ü¶ã or feel remotely safe health-wise doing ANYTHING, especially when masks aren‚Äôt involved‚Äîsince we know that vaccines nor boosters prevent the spread of Covid. Just be grateful that you can do things you want to right now, and that you don‚Äôt have to fear for your lives as your country is not currently being invaded by basically a single sociopath that doesn‚Äôt care if he has to kill men women or children to steal land that he decided he WANTS. 
If a Ukrainian somehow comes across this, sending so much love!!!

Hahaha this is the most ADHD post ever (yes my current health conditions that make me ‚ù§Ô∏è masks cause significant cognitive impairments, yay). Anyone who‚Äôs still reading, PROPS forrealz

Comment: Oh my god! yes! wearing a mask all the time and taking off during eating is such a comical idea. My friends did it because they did not want to offend family members. It was a tough call. Either you go to that special event wearing a mask or risk-taking wrath from the family members for not coming. Overall, people have mixed emotions because we are trying to do what's best for us, for family members, and for kids. Our emotions hardly leave our imaginary circle of closed contacts and think about the population at large. Plus, politics and mixed messages from media do not help either.

Reply: @@thedude4672 In mid-January, just a few short weeks ago, a Rasmussen poll found that 59% of Democrats wanted the unvexxed to be under house arrest.  54% favored fines or prison sentences on "vaccine" critics.  51% wanted the unvexxed locked in detention (concentration) camps.  And 22% wanted the state to take away the children of anyone not willing to inject themselves with the clot shot.

These people will never be forgiven for trying to use the power of the state to impose their own psychoses on the population at large.

Humanity is Being Liberated as White Hat Alliance Goes on the Offensive
By Benjamin Fulford Weekly Reports 
The Russian and Jewish people are finally getting justice for the Holodomor and the Holocaust, mass murder human sacrifice events staged by the Khazarian mafia. This is thanks to a Russian police operation against the Khazarian mafia operating inside their borders. The Russian action against the KM is just part of a larger international move by the white hat alliance to remove the KM from all positions of power, Asian and Western secret society sources agree.

In Asia, an agreement has been reached to unify Taiwan and China and form a friendly alliance with Japan, a unified Korea and ASEAN, dragon family sources say. Asian secret societies say that humanity is now 3/4 liberated from the Satanic Khazarian mafia.

When this is all over, there will be a jubilee, world peace and the start of a new Golden Age, alliance sources promise.

Here is a bullet-point summary of what Russian Presidential Avatar Vladimir Putin had to say about the operation in Ukraine:

This has to do with the entire system of international relations‚Ä¶fundamental norms that were adopted following WWII‚Ä¶came in the way of those who declared themselves the winners of the Cold War‚Ä¶[The Khazarian mafia] had a feeling of absolute superiority‚Ä¶coupled with the low cultural standards‚Ä¶For our country, it is a matter of life and death We had to stop that atrocity:, that genocide of the millions of people who live there,,,we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians‚Ä¶We all know that having justice and truth on our side is what makes us truly strong.

Comment: Pathetic. This nonsense has been going on for 2 years. It never made any sense that a mask made out of an old dish rag or bed sheet was going to stop a virus that's 1/20 the diameter of a human hair. Plus, it's obvious that the vax efficacy has a short lifetime (a few months). Otherwise, you wouldn't need boosters.

Vax mandates and passports have just made us like the old USSR. Freedom is so passe.

Bonus round - With only a few months of testing, how can anyone know the long term effects of the vax? My suspicions are that much higher because CDC and Pfizer won't release the test data (okay, they've agreed to do it over the next 75 years!), you have to agree to not sue the drug companies if anything goes wrong, all other therapies and approaches besides the vax have been sidelined and denigrated and any dissenting opinions have been censored.

Reply: if they weren't too busy gaslighting, basically becoming a propaganda group and shaming and lying to the people, then yeah maybe they actually wouldve focused on what could have been comedy. But alas these fucking failed abortion morons (and yes i can make that joke cause they actively support it) spent 2 years helping to ruin everyones lives with their propaganda and dumbfuckery, and proceeded to do a complete 180 when they realized their corporation was a joke that nobody liked, and that elections were coming up and they needed to help daddy joe and the rest of the democrats make it look like he actually did something useful.

The stats really say this is true. This from a maskless anti-vax individual who has YET to contract said virus!

Comment: Out of an office full of people, my husband and his friend who masked faithfully (his friend had a preexisting condition and was really careful because of it) were the only ones out of the entire office that didn‚Äôt get Covid.  Neither did anyone in their families (the ones living in the immediate household of these two men).  The anti maskers all got covid, gave it to their wives and children, some entered the hospital because they couldn‚Äôt breathe, etc.  Then because some believed that they couldn‚Äôt get it again after getting it once, they continued to not wear a mask and then‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶got covid AGAIN.  A bunch of people in our communities died of it, and it just makes me wonder who didn‚Äôt have to die if they had simply been more careful.  Matter of fact one of our town officials just died of it three days ago after living on a ventilator for awhile.  It‚Äôs just sad to me that politics had any role in this, and that a political ‚Äústance‚Äù became more important than health, safety, and common sense.  Who gives a sh-t what some politicians said?  None of them give a flying crap about any of us in real life, they aren‚Äôt going to love us back if we love them, and they certainly aren‚Äôt present in our lives-so why would anyone risk their life or the lives of someone that they love for some political liar on a podium who wouldn‚Äôt do the same for you???  And they ALL lie.  On both sides of the aisle, and if you don‚Äôt know that then I feel incredibly sad at your na√Øvet√©.

Reply: I‚Äôm not sure how to dissect your word salad. So to sum up, your personal office anecdote indicates that masks worked (many others would say they didn‚Äôt do anything- people got sick regardless) - in your rejoinder you attach a rant about how politicians, who made this whole thing worse with terrible solutions -should not be trusted. Agree. So your point?

Reply: Did it? SF Killed 100 million people as opposed to the reported 5.9 million CV deaths (mind you- that‚Äôs with or from Covid stats). My grandmother lived through the Spanish flu epidemic and no one wore masks unless perhaps treating a sick patient. Which has been medical protocol for a very long time. Just common sense. Masks were not a virtue signaling fashion accessory for the entire population. I think it‚Äôs time for common sense to make a return to the public consciousness. A lot of bad actors made a lot of money off this mask fad. Which is now considered a joke outside of at least somewhat sterile medical setting

Comment: I'm going to keep wearing a mask. Japan's been doing it for years - not just for healthy reasons, but it's fashionable there. I am autistic and I suffer with agoraphobia and it actually helped me go into places and go outside. I don't have to worry about my weird facial expressions or worry about my facial hair or SMILING. Also it's works very well as a sun block (especially since its finally being acknowledged how poisonous and cancerous sun blocks are). üò∑

Comment: Science doesn't change? 
That's like saying facts don't change...
Everything changes with time. If you say facts don't change then why isn't slavery still legal, because factually it was fine for centuries.  Those people knew that slaves had every human emotion and still said that it was proven they didn't.  If facts don't change then women should be home listening to their husband's, because scientists said women were too emotional, dumb, hysterical, etc, to be allowed to think for themselves.  If facts don't change then why are people being allowed to have sexual realignment surgery? 
There are many times we have changed facts, some right some wrong, but the only true thing is that facts and science aren't set in stone.  To err is human.

Comment: Watching this, I can't help but think how couples on the show are nearly always (or perhaps literally always) heterosexual.  McKinnon, Yang, and other gay cast are always playing straight characters unless being gay is specifically part of the skit.  The characters never just happen to be gay.  Be better, SNL.  You can do it.

Comment: It‚Äôs so absurdly true. I have family from Boston and NYC, hardcore Sox and Yankees fans, who I‚Äôve seen make it through thanksgiving and family reunions for 39 years, but this shit is on another level. They won‚Äôt even let their kids visit each other anymore. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not staying at your crazy cousins house ‚Ä¶. Forget it ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre dead to us‚Äù

Reply: Don't give them credit for being "true". These are the same drones who spent the last two years trying to shame everyone into submission to "Science" (really, just the proclamations of supposed authorities). They deserve less credit than the proverbial broken clock that tells the right time once a day -- at least the clock wasn't lying to you and trying to get you fired.

Reply: as soon as they joke about it enough and make the maskies feel dumb and like changing back. They created a false binary, the masking did nothing good, probably did bad, but society is split between those who think a paper over their face is life and death while everyone who has ever sanded a piece of wood knows that is ridiculous. 

They will joke about it some more. Gaslight like they weren't wrong on purpose, then turf some normies into taking off their masks bc they are insane, illogical rule followers to a fault.

Comment: My favorite is how people who never wore masks consistently or properly now like to say "See? None of that made a difference anyway." WELL IT DIDN'T IN AMERICA, KYLE. Even the states with lots of care in policy and action continually saw their efforts stymied by the Floridas and Tennessees and Texases. We were told from the beginning something like mask policy/vaccination needed to be observed by 85% of a population to matter most. We've never gotten there. So of course we've never seen the benefit.

The truth is people suffered, died alone, lost family, lost their jobs, and children will be the most affected due to developmental issues.

Reply: Are you saying that nobody was saying that they think it's hilarious when people that are anti-vaxxers died from covid I just saw something on television today about the same thing they're giving people crap because two people in Arkansas or Tennessee or whatever half-ass state they live in that they didn't get vaccine so it's hard to feel sorry for him and then the father who lost custody of his kids because he refused to get vaccinated you must be living in some fantasy world

Comment: SNL, so cutting edge in parroting the Democrats' narrative. When Democrats were pushing mask mandates and vax mandates SNL was right there along with the rest of the Entertainment Complex parroting their ideology. Last week internal Democrat strategy paper saying that ppl were sick of masks and Democrats were getting hammered was leaked. Then SURPRISE SURPRISE Democrat leaders started announcing an end to restrictions. And here comes SNL to help push the new narrative. Look up 'agitprop'.

Comment: The left weaponized COVID for their political needs.  However, within this COVID fiasco there were real victims.  Many people lost incomes, small businesses were closed, families were torn apart as people were caught up in the frenzy.  All of that now positioned as a joke, as the professionally political left try to find a way to tell their tribe it‚Äôs over.

We are supposed to forget the pain they inflicted as loved ones were choking in anguish, unable to visit family in hospital, the funerals that were not permitted, the catastrophic damage to our children‚Äôs lives, and the massive ridicule deployed (with maximum snark) in their condescending attacks against anyone who did not kneel at the altar of COVID virtue signaling.  All of it‚Ä¶. ALL OF IT‚Ä¶ now boiled down to a few jokes as they walk backwards trying to avoid the political fallout.

They are declaring victory, and moving on.

These are sick people.

Reply: Covid has become a cult or religion to these types of people, the mask is a religious symbol, social distancing is a religious tradition and the lockdowns are a religious ceremony to them and Fauci is their high priest. They are completely devoid of all critical thinking and rational understanding. Whatever the government and the tv tell them to think and do, they obey without dissent.

Reply: Which should tell everyone that this sketch wasn't about being anti-mask per se.
But the people here in the comments projecting their political buffoonery won't get it. They have an agenda.

Comment: *The 'funny thing' about this sketch is that the topic involved is NOT FUNNY*
___________
*Millions of idiots opinions do not 'factually overcome' the knowledge of even one person whose occupation in life is the study of 'Virology'*
___________
*The entire rationale of 'Masking' and 'Avoiding close confined contact' with others was to SLOW THE SPREAD OF TRANSMISSION until a vaccine could be developed*
___________
*HOW IN PHUQUE millions are unable to comprehend that is startling and confusing*

Reply: I disagree, I think it was to make everyone breathe in their own emission and touch their face and INCREASE THE SPREAD OF TRANSMISSION. But of course a simpleton like you would not be able to see that was the goal, making everyone more sick physically and mentally.

Comment: Well seeing how as soon as you sit down to eat or drink your mask can come off, or the students in the school band can cut holes in their mask near their mouth for their instruments, and athletes wearing the masks under their chin I'd say the masks have ALWAYS been pointless in this "pandemic"...and don't get me started on the word antivaxer. No one who refuses the covid "vaccine" is antivax considering, according to Oxford Dictionary these vaccines are absolutely not true vaccines. So they can toss that thinking right out the window. And these shots do not in anyway help when it comes to covid....just ask all the healthcare workers who are working under staffed, and not just bc Hochul fired everyone, but bc the remaining vaccinated are all out with covidü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ü§£ü§®üôÑ

Comment: A friend died of cancer which might have caught earlier if it wasn't for the Covid regulations that resulted in a canceled checkup. Another friend lost his job because he wasn't an "essential worker."

So go f off Snl. Your only doing this sketch because the polls are showing the public turning against the Covid regs and your liberal masters are worried about getting wiped out at the ballot box.

Please get me back to my family so we can be extinguished together forever.

Comment: It's nice to see SNL, which typically leans far left, voice some of the concerns associated with right-leaning people without saying they're stupid or completely unfounded. There's been a lot of misinformation circulating around the past two years, which is why people are hesitant to trust anything the government says.
People aren't stupid or "science-deniers" for pointing out that a lot of the information we've received during the pandemic has been wrong or changed. It's more a concern of how much is information is actual science and how much is propaganda.

Also, nobody should be losing their jobs because they choose not to be vaccinated. The government cannot dictate what people do with their bodies.

Comment: BY FAR the most important SNL skit since the one that ran during the financial crisis with George W. Bush, Barney Frank, among others, and subprime lenders appearing above a chyron that read "People Who Should Be Shot".  Sadly that skit is no longer available anywhere on the 'net except as a transcript, because the writers mistakenly ran that chyron below people who, while they sold their business to Wachovia/Wells Fargo for a substantial profit, were never implicated in criminal activity related to the collapse in the housing market.

I definitely commend NBC and SNL for acknowledging that those of us who had studied similar outbreaks of the past and recommended isolating the sick and vulnerable while allowing everyone else to carry on as usual WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG.

Comment: The West chose a different stratergy to the East(New Zealand is an exception to that,,,,https://youtu.be/bQDPQ8bz7cU).
Many other countries chose to celebrate stopping their weak from dying.
The West chose(stocks/economy)to celebrate once the weak had stopped dying(just let in run for a month and it'll be all over, was the far-right outcry), they did try and go as fast as they could(I think Biden slowed America's race/position to open up without restrictions), being pro-vax/mask or not was irrelevant to Trump and Boris, quarantined borders during and after an early lockdown was the way to go......and they cared more about winning the race to celebrate when the weak stopping dying, so they can open up without restrictions before others.
unfortunately for some, it wasn't done fast enough.
Trump said "New York should have ordered more ventilators" after only stopping flights from China and still allowing Europe to continue to flying into the east coast.

'Sophistry' - the use of clever but false arguments, especially with the intention of deceiving.

Reply: That was a good point. However science is constantly evolving the more we actually study and apply the scientific method. But the point that public policy changes on a whim (usually for the worse) based on non vetted scientific data - just conjecture. Is maddening. And yes, would not fly at home or work.

There were SOOOOO many clues and lies and "left out" analytics that a child could have seen the deception. Now you can own it because your all set to see how your medical "experiment" pans out. Not to worry because Im sure something so simple as your complex,  DNA sequence was COMPLETELY understood  before you shot some unknown, untested messenger RNA solution into it. Check back in 5-10 years, maybe sooner??  You can be smug once your cancers are set in

Comment: At the beginning we were told to flatten the curve and there was little 'science' on the virus - it sucked, but I thought the shutdown was the right call. As time went on, science showed that vaccinated or not, variants of the virus would transmit -- at that time, the citizens should've demanded a return to normal BUT the virus had become a political tool/weapon. The tool was used to divide during the Presidential election, then to further divide after the election.

Comment: John Mulaney is why SNL has sucked for so many years. I don't know why SNL has thought putting him in front of the camera would make anything better. I don't want to be one of those SNL "good old days"  people, but what's it going to take to get this show back to something people want to watch again? Replace Mulaney ASAP and get Keenan the hell off too!

Comment: Yes!!! Shut everything down again but make it illegal to take off the masks!!! It‚Äôs so obvious!!!!! 

Honestly making light of the fact that were shuttered in for years for literally no reason is such a privileged celebrity mindset. This pandemic has widened the gap of how real people and celebrity babies perceive reality. Our income was shut off, we were cast out for asking questions that were valid and had the same science behind it years ago, families lost loved ones without legally being able to say goodbye, and a whole generation of children is socially inept. That‚Äôs all according to science too. 

So the people that get upset about that are ridiculous and we should laugh at them? This is the most disgusting portrayal of punching down I‚Äôve ever seen. Literally EVERYONE in the country was NEEDLESSLY hurt by these lockdowns that did nothing to help. If we would‚Äôve followed the science and put all of that lockdown money into protecting specifically the people at risk instead of the entire globe, we would‚Äôve seen a lot less deaths. How ridiculous and insane for a government to except everyone in the entire world to take a brand new launched vaccine while having their personal freedom and income held hostage. A complete fuck up of an idea that was never reworked and only pushed harder and harder until the country is almost in collapse. 

I don‚Äôt think this is funny. I think politicians and snarky celebrities times are coming to an end. People are just gonna start throwing Molotovs soon. It‚Äôs just human nature. You keep punching down on people already down on their luck and they‚Äôre gonna blow up. 

The fact that they laugh at the idea of having compassion for the people in country is sickening. They‚Äôll criticize people that lost everything for not having compassion themselves, just because they were actually following the science instead of non-scientist ran media companies that have shown time and time again to be corrupt and driving for financial interests. Fuck you

Comment: Cool that it's suddenly okay to ask questions like this according to the media/entertainment industry. Most Americans outside of a handful of cities like NYC, LA, SF, etc., were having these conversations over a year ago. No, mask mandates accomplished nothing. Closing parks, playgrounds, and beaches accomplished nothing. Wearing masks outside like total psychos accomplished nothing. Closing schools was the biggest mistake in American politics probably since the Iraq War, if not Vietnam, but it did accomplish SOMETHING, which was setting millions of kids back in their education. Vaccine mandates accomplished nothing. They did nothing to stop the spread of omicron, but it did lead to people being fired for no reason.

Oh well. It's just the last two years of our lives. More SNL sketches please!

... and I‚Äôll stand corrected: I am actually college educated, well-travelled, multi-lingual, ex-democrat (yes, did vote for Biden), non-white Los Angeles CA resident who chose to simply be open-minded and listen to good doctors & experts around the globe who didn‚Äôt agree with mainstream narrative! I Read scientific papers, check the facts as opposed to follow the so called ‚Äúfact-checkers‚Äù, used my mind & critical thinking with reminders of past/current corrupt practices of big Pharma, big Tech, Media companies (and their true bosses), Wall Street and all their scams/scandals and let‚Äôs not forget the lying politicians from both parties...
I exercised my freedom to do what I believed was best for my health & body which was not to get vaccinated! 
Needless to say, I lost all respect for SNL when they were part of the propaganda machine causing divisiveness between vaccinated & unvaccinated!

Reply: They still can't face the fact that the virus did indeed come from a lab. They are professionals at ignoring unpleasant realities. It's only going to get worse for then as more truth comes out.

Comment: So, because SOMEONE apparently just saw "Andalusian Dog", I have to suffer?  Dropping all of those images into the sketch didn't make it any funnier, it just made it GROSS, and, for me, UNWATCHABLE.  Ooooh, EDGY.

Comment: The fact that a "liberal" tv show can laugh at itself about some of the things they got wrong about the pandemic is a fresh of breath air, Fox News would never admit they made a mistake or laugh about themselves...

Comment: Something tells me this is the sketch that SNL pivots and stops catering to the left wing nut jobs and comes more center like the show used to be when they made fun of everyone.  Lot's of people that were far left have been awakened by this pandemic and BS politics involved.  I mean, Jesus Christ, Russell Brand has started being accused of being right wing and his YouTube channel has 5 million subs in less than a year. 

SNL sees the writing on the wall.  You can't deal in insanity but for so long and stay in business.  Look at how much effort the prop people put into this sketch.

Comment: "The UK had done tons of testing and had even more Covid".
Wait,... what? 
They had more Covid results because... 
*freezes and darts eyes back and forth* they tested widely for it. 
That means they didn't have  even more Covid.
*pauses to wipe anxiety sweats with a bath towel*
They were simply more aware of the actual numbers... *relaxing a bit* 
As opposed to not testing at all. *growing in confidence* 
There would be the same amount of Covid cases, in either case. However, *smiling widely with selfassuredness* without testing there'd be zero data to show it.

*brief pause*

*Heidi comes back, I get Thanos'd, then she disappears again*

Comment: This would be far more funny if people hadn't actually lost jobs over this.  If restaurant owners and employees hadn't lost their employment over this.  If small business across America (and the world) hadn't been forced to close their doors because they couldn't compete with Big Business in the face of government overreaction to COVID. If government leaders everywhere hadn't chosen to divide us over this. 

As truth stares in the face of lies,  STILL at the end of the "dinner discussion" SNL needs to jab at the unvaccinated.  

Personally, I'm still wondering where Joe's hoped for "Winter Of Death" went.  Propaganda will go on.

Reply: Don‚Äôt let them off the hook then. They thought it was fine to ostracize ppl who didn‚Äôt trust the ‚Äúvaccine,‚Äù or felt it was their body, their choice. They don‚Äôt get to just laugh it off now. Remember, they smugly hoped for death for the unvaxxed because of their inability to accept a differing opinion. They need to be held accountable for the misery & pain they gleefully inflicted on their fellow Americans. Never forget!

Comment: "We did our best." No we didn't! We were acting like pussies making kids wear masks in school when adults were going to bars and restaurants almost this whole time bc "it's annoying" or "I can't breathe" which is 100% not true you can absolutely breathe many healthcare workers breathe perfectly fine with masks. I am 100% mask mandates but they were never implemented wide-spread in a way that made sense. So pissed off at this whole country for its lack of capacity to protect one another and make some sacrifices that would have saved lives.

Comment: The reason mask mandates don't work is not because masks are inherently ineffective--it's because you're never going to get people to wear them consistently and correctly.  Better just to avoid human contact, if you're that worried about COVID.  And, yes--if you're going to go out to restaurants, you might as well burn your masks.  Masking rigorously at all other times and then going out to eat with a group of people makes about as much sense as walking around with a condom on all the time and taking it off for sex.

Reply: @@elcadejo44 well, here's the thing. I think they work under a small range of conditions. And they were better than nothing for stopping some transmission. Hell, weeks before I heard of masking on TV I was wondering if I should cover my face while shopping. But trying mask mandates even a year in wasn't the same as early on. 

I mean, holy shit, we all made it a lifestyle. I have a friend whose wife, herself only like 26 or 27, is likely going to take years to unmask in public he told me. She dug in hard. Me too, but I recognized I was getting irrationality angry at strangers and worked it out in therapy in summer 2021. Now I'm with you all. I'm sorry I was one of the people who was so harsh. I was scared. I thought this was what was going to keep me safe. An immunocompromised family member who lives with me safe. Our country safe! And over it in no time if we just "buckle down" etc. Wasn't considering the mental health issues that arise from spending all this time without normal socialization etc. Took living through it to learn the hard way. Now I won't go back, and to my friend's credit, who also were very much like me, some of them have figured it out too. "If I get Covid, I'll stay home and see you all in two weeks. No need to not hang out 'in case' ". 

Please forgive me.

Reply: Another point I heard someone make was that with that vaccine passport, you could still have covid and go anywhere you wanted. 
This point was made by someone with the vaccine who had gotten covid (mildly, of course).

I might add that you could also have just gotten tested moments ago and still not be allowed places.

But no, in no way was this effort focused on practicality so much as it was force and coercion. We messed up our economy, tried to fix it will nonsensical policy all the while ignoring crucial information (mostly because it was being censored).

Reply: @Drank Zappa People made honest efforts based on the science at hand, dealing with a novel virus, because they have empathy. And strep, tuberculosis, and herpes are not interchangeable with Covid. They don‚Äôt work the same way. Plus you still shouldn‚Äôt be going out spreading those around anyway, either. If you‚Äôre sick, you should ideally stay stay at home. Except millions can‚Äôt afford to skip work when sick because of the horrible system corporations and capitalism have wrought. Did you get mad about washing your hands, too? What‚Äôs wrong with taking a test? Did you complain when you had to get a TB test to enter school? God forbid people should do their best to live in a community that values teamwork over selfishness.

Reply: If you didn't think it was ridiculous the very moment it was implemented, then you need to reevaluate your thought process. It was also a great example of the govt saying "no matter how ridiculous or illogical the rule, you need to comply or else!" If you're well informed and believe in your stance, grow a spine and don't put up with bullshit. The truth isn't a comfortable subject in many if not most cases.

'Civic responsibility' you are preaching is a thing that everyone should have the right to choose not to have forced upon them. I dont give a fck if you like to think that by wearing a mask (when not being actualy sick 99 percent of the time, and WHEN actualy being sick and infecting someone its super low chance of dying, varying chance, of course, depending on age and other factors... still low chance) you are saving the world, you do what you want, but forcing it on others in no little thing, its not trivial, and dont pretend it is, you hypocrate. Its absolute control and almost nobody fckng Likes wearing them. We as INDIVIDUALS dont HAVE to care about the weakest and the poor, and more often than not, we dont, we leave it to our governing bodies. If you want to practice what you preach you could've done many things for these groups way before the pandemic. Did you though? Did you volunteer? Did you gave some money to charitable organizations? Hospitals? Homeless shelters? Dude, I could fck you up on many different levels when it comes to 'civic responsibility', about using plastic, for example, or non-renewable energy, about using products that are directly tied to child labour in other countries etc. As a society, with improving ways to help people medicaly we are saving lives, we are as a society, 'civicly responsible', we dont euthanise the retrdd, or handicaped who have very little way of giving something back. But thats on a societal level, you morron, not on an individual level. As an individual i should have the right to choose to participate in mask wearing, same as in i choose to give some money to charity. Everyone is already showing their 'civic responsibility' by paying fxkng enormous taxes!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything else.. schools, roads, communication, health is up for the government to manage. So stop this fckng stpd rethoric, because clearly you have no fxkng jdea what you are spouting. You are just being a parrot without giving a second thought to what this nonsesne of yours.

There were people, scientists, and health experts who were desperately screaming from the rooftops to have a fair discussion about the policies/restrictions that were being put in place, but instead of being heard, they were casted away and demonized for their intentions. People lost their jobs for having ‚Äúunacceptable views‚Äù. Others, their mental health was crippled by long periods of isolation, and not to forget the insurmountable amount of people that took their own life as a result of the conditions they were dealing with.

Also, I‚Äôve heard it said, ‚Äúif you thought it had the smallest chance of preventing someone else from getting sick or dying, wouldn‚Äôt you wear a mask or get vaccinated?‚Äù But by that logic, if you think there‚Äôs the slightest chance that it could prevent it by wearing an entire body hazmat suit, you should‚Ä¶ and hardly any ‚Äúvirtuous‚Äù mask wearing person is doing that. And that would arguably be exponentially more effective, but nobody is gonna do that lol

Reply: Wearing a face mask can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community by reducing the release of respiratory droplets from asymptomatic / pre-symptomatic individuals or those with mild non-specific symptoms. The use of face masks for this purpose may be adopted to reduce the societal impact associated with absence from work or healthcare pressures due to infection, or to protect vulnerable individuals in particular settings.

Why DO i have to wear shirt at a restaurant??? XD lol? What kind of example is that? People wear shirts and  clothes because they are cold and self-concious, they wouldnt undress even if you urged them to... Have no idea what that has to do with 'public health' :Dd lol... Your examples are terrible. Peeing on a fckng street is gross and smelly, if everyone started shtng in public spaces we would be living in a fckng bangladesh... How would we be living without wearing masks? Oh, guess what ! We know! Same fckng way we WERE living up until 2020... Ambulance? Again, I fckng repeat, the super vast majority of people wearing masks arent sick, 99 percent of people are perfectly fine, YET they fckng are FORCED to wear a mask ALL THE fckng TIME (oh, i could write an essay about the hipocricy and stpd times when people are allowed to take them off deeming all this fasad pointless)... When an ambulance is driving somewhere, its not MAYBE an emergency that MAY cause some serious ill (like covid, not scary at all, sorry) it IS an actual emergency happening at that moment! Also, its super rare that you need to let them pass..., while you are wearing the mask all the fckng time. Fck these people love tripping over their idiotic, nonsensic analogies, thats the only fckng way they can communicate, they cant stay on the actual subject. Wearing a fckng mask is not a 'minor inconvenience'. Trying to drown you in the weeds of their analogies, lol. How about going the other way? If im suddenly responsible for a fckng virus i didnt ask for, nor created, nor injected in myself at my own free will, if im suddenly responsible for a virus going through me and KILLING PEOPLE. So we should prosecute everyone who got sick woth murder? Im safe. I didnt have covid. Why the fck should i suffer for the mere mini chance of getting sick, infecting someone else and mini chance that someone will die off of it.? Maybe then people who actualy were sick should be persecuted by that logic? After all its a murder! Fckng retrds are comparing it to roadkill after all!

2.  The masks didn't do squat as has been proven.  Washing your hands and keeping your fingers out of your mouth and nose helped.  Not having sick people in close proximity to those most at risk of fatal complications would have helped if Cuomo hadn't dumped Covid patients into nursing homes.  The masks and other nonsense did nothing but virtue signal.  
3.  Perhaps some actual effort on developing effective TREATMENTS would have been nice rather than sidelining any mention of that in favor of masks, shutdowns, and unending booster cycles of vaccines which still allow you to catch and pass the disease as my entire family did despite vaccination and boosters.

The mask impedes breathing, fogs glasses, gets dirty, has to be taken off to eat, and hides identities of thieves and muggers. I was carjacked by three thugs in masks. So yes. The paper mask DOES HURT ME because anyone and everyone can get away with wearing a mask in broad daylight. 

And if you're wearing the mask because the CDC or government told you to, or the radio shamed you to wear them, or your radical friends ostracized anyone who didn't wear them....then you're following a crowd.

If a truck goes over a pedestrian, they will be crushed. Stopping will prevent the truck going over the pedestrian. 

If a person coughs on someone else, that next person may become sick. If a masked person coughs on someone else, that next person is just as likely to become sick. 

Your stupid analogy comes from false equivalence. You've been brainwashed. 

Additionally, stop signs and lights are ideal spots for you to be carjacked. If there's no traffic at a stop sign, pull up, slow down, check for crossers, and then roll across. It's called the California roll, or a rolling stop. It promoted healthy traffic movement and it KEEPS YOU SAFE.

So now weve broken down why not only are masks and cars incomparable, we've also demonstrated logical exceptions to following ordinary strict and necessary regulation.

Reply: Well I can top that! I have never had any pulmonary diagnosis, but have been dealing with a post nasal drip cough and went to a pulmonologist for the first time ever. The office is still "requiring" you to wear a mask! There are signs everywhere and even in the doctor's small office was a sign that said if you do not wear one you will be asked to leave and have to call to make a "tele-med appointment!" As a nurse for 30 years, last time I checked you cannot to a "physical exam" like listening to your patient's lungs, heart rate, looking into their throat and nares (nostrils), observe them "in person" for their breathing/wheezing etc. via "tele-med!" This is a "pulmonary practice" for God's sake, meaning that patients "have difficulty breathing" and you are still requiring them to wear cloth coverings over their mouths and noses despite the fact that it doesn't stop a virus! I had to stand in front of a machine to have my temperature reading done and the "machine" verbally stated to "put your mask on" etc. I couldn't help myself, I was upset and said out loud - "So you have to wear your mask to get your temperature read now!" I took my mask off in the doctor's room, I refused to wear it! It is difficult to have any faith left in any of our medical establishments when this garbage is still allowed to continue! By the way, I completed 4 years of a BSN in a grueling, 1 year, accelerated program, graduated with honors and gave the graduation speech. I also obtained A+s in Anatomy and Physiology! I also worked in pharmacovigilance in Big Pharma for 17.5 years.

Reply: @@tjones5719 Seriously? Would you walk into a burning room with smoke all around with a surgical mask on thinking you're protected? No, of course not. Because it doesn't provide ANY filtration. Surgical masks are not form fitting, they have creases on the sides and air escapes through the creases and around your nose. That's why sunglasses or glasses get fogged when you wear a mask. It's because you're breathing AROUND the fabric, not through it. I wouldn't sand the bottom of my boat with only a surgical mask on. The virus is aerosolized. The "droplets" we're talking about are microscopic and fill the air as if they were a gas. This is why the "experts" put out columns recently like "it's time to up your mask game." They claim its because of Omicron but Omicron virions aren't smaller than previous variants. They are just now getting around to telling us what THEY KNEW ALL along. Surgical masks don't provide protection for the wearer, period. That's never what they were intended for and they have never been shown to be effective at it.

The government doesn‚Äôt have any grand plans to control people or whatever; Democrats made covid deaths a political issue and that any deaths was a further blow towards one‚Äôs credibility in the 2020 election. Vaccines are incredibly effective at preventing death, so it makes sense that the government would be desperate to do whatever possible to prevent those deaths.

Reply: @@MegCazalet voluntarily being given the option to stay at home is vastly different from losing your job and being unable to work at a business with more than 100 people unless you get a vaccine that only provides protection for six months. The only other vaccine mandates have been made years after the release of the vaccine, and apply to genetically stable RNA viruses (like measles and mumps) or DNA viruses (like smallpox before it went extinct). The nature of these viruses means that the mutation rate is far slower (less chances for genetic mistranscription or mistranslation) so vaccine induced antibodies will be effective at recognizing the viruses for years. That gives enough time to inoculate the entire population. As it stands, for every new booster, it takes months to approve it for non-adults, during which time, protection decreases. So we‚Äôll never hit herd immunity. Thus, vaccines are not effective long term in preventing covid.  They ARE incredibly effective at preventing serious illness, but only in the person who is vaccinated. So if you‚Äôre vaccinated, your coworkers being vaccinated does not significantly lower your chances of getting covid. Even with boosters, protection from infection is ~78% immediately afterwards, and goes down to ~45% nine weeks after. The one exception is if you had two Pfizer shots and then one moderna booster, where 70% protection lasts up to 10 weeks. Thus, the demographic most likely to be protected would be people under 40 (as Pfizer is the vaccine recommended for that age group), whereas the rest of the adult population would have <40% chance of protection after ten weeks. Thus, it‚Äôs simply not sustainable to constantly ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill to protect people from a disease that they will likely get once in their lives. The yearly initial cost of Pfizer  shots was $19.5 per shot in the US. In the UK, Pfizer has raised the price 22%, from ¬£18 to ¬£22 with the order of boosters. If also they raise their prices by 22% in the US in response to demand as they did in the UK, that‚Äôs $23.79 per shot, $47.58 per adult per year, 209 m adults, $9.9 billion in taxpayer money per year. We could pay for four additional years of schooling for every American child who needs it for $7 billion, $2 billion less.

Reply: @@danielkurnick6493 because there are laws against public indecency? Which that qualifies as? The laws around vaccine mandates are established on the Jacobson v Massachusetts Supreme Court case, which essentially states that one can‚Äôt use their individual rights to violate the rights of others. The reasoning is based on the Ninth Amendment, that no law may be construed to disparage or deny other right enumerated in the constitution. That means that you can‚Äôt exercise a right if it denies or disparages the rights retained by others. In the case of all vaccine mandates before this one, the viruses were genetically stable enough that vaccine protection would last years. That means that herd immunity was possible. Essentially, if it is guaranteed that you not being vaccinated would be the only way someone could be infected with an illness and die from it, then you‚Äôve denied them the right to life that they would have otherwise retained had you been vaccinated. This only applies to cases where it is guaranteed that that person would not have otherwise died or suffered serious injury if you hadn‚Äôt chosen to express your right to expression through refusing a vaccine. This is not the case with Covid vaccines, as they only last six months. If every single adult had been vaccinated the day they became eligible, it is guaranteed that people would still have died as a result of catching covid at least two weeks after everyone got the second shot. That means that other people getting the vaccine had no effect on whether these people lived or died. However, given that vaccines are incredibly effective at preventing serious illness, it is guaranteed that had certain people been able to get the vaccine, they would have survived. Thus, vaccine access IS a determinant in someone‚Äôs right to life and liberty. Before the vaccine, mask mandates were legal. This is because it is guaranteed that whether you get covid before or after being vaccinated is the difference between life or death. Thus, if you infect someone with covid before they have the opportunity to protect themselves, you are depriving them of their right to life by getting them sick BEFORE they could be vaccinated, and thus you getting them sick before the vaccine would cause them to die when a few months later it would not. Mask mandates are thus legal. However, now that everyone has access to the vaccine, people have the means to protect their lives. Thus, getting them infected is not robbing them of a right to life that they would have otherwise enjoyed. If they are going to die regardless of the vaccine, and the virus is endemic, you are not going to deny them the right to life by expressing your own rights, as they would have the same amount of protection regardless of whether they were infected by someone vaccinated or unvaccinated. Thus, you being unvaccinated (with COVID, and only Covid and the seasonal flu) is not directly violating the civil liberties of others any more than someone vaccinated.

Reply: @@kimnarisetti5384 ironic that here you are like your bosses trying to pretend you understand science.  It doesn‚Äôt appear you do when you have to create a logical fallacy in your faulty analogy (the birth control example).  Let me help by trying to improve the analogy to be truly comparable to vaccines.

First you cherry picked data and only focused on the booster efficacy (with no source mind you).  You should be using the vaccine and series of vaccines not just one component.  According to the CDC the booster with the other vaccinations was 94% effective preventing emergency room visits and 82% effective preventing urgent care visits.

So now that we improved the data used in your analogy it already gets to the level where you likely would say yes, birth control or confirms that are above 80% effective would be something to advocate with your daughter.

The second improvement of the analogy is the incomparable consequences.  Now getting pregnant or an STI are bad but nowhere near as bad as dying within say a month.  This is a harder one to correct and really says the two situations just aren‚Äôt comparable.  You would have to change the analogy to something more threatening perhaps treating suicidal thoughts would rise to that level and could cause an immediate loss of life of left untreated.  So would you provide a loved one a treatment for suicidal thoughts with above an 80% effective rate at preventing the issue getting so bad that he or she needs to seek medical attention?  A reasonable person would.

Only a fully publicly educated person could say something so stupid. No, sweetheart, millions can't afford it because they're too busy buying all the luxury items that capitalism has provided them and then can't understand why they suddenly can't afford healthcare - it's because people don't typically rank healthcare as important as their new fu4king car!!!!!

Reply: @@tjones5719 I will point to them now.  Wearing masks regardless of the level of assistance they provide.  You clearly are thinking of this from a partisan standpoint.  The issue is that a loud group of mostly progressive Americans have adopted a mindset of low risk tolerance.  It would appear that if risk aversion could be rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most risk averse, the group of people most supportive of masks seem to want life to be lived with a risk aversion of about 11.  How much risk you are willing to tolerate is a personal judgement call.  In terms of society, we will tolerate the risk that the mean average of Americans will tolerate.  I assure you, its not 10.  It‚Äôs more like 5.  By responding the way you did I can only assume that your mindset is if masks help, we should wear them forever, regardless of the tolerances of risk and statistical probabilities.  I have been vaccinated, with two boosters.  I also had Covid 3 times.  My point is that there is another scenario here that a group of folks seem truly loathe to consider:  Covid is a new and novel disease.  We can do far less to prevent infections and spreads than we would like.  Some people are so averse to this reality that they are willing to take on ANY MEASURES whatsoever as long as the have some value to prevent infections.  Coupled to this idea is that no one, should ever, ever have to die of this.  Additionally, a new idea that people should try to avoid any risk.  The reality is that Covid is here, endemic, and people are going to continue to die.  The good of the many outweighs the good of the few.  Some people are going to die and some people are going to live.  The average person should not have to drastically alter their lives (and wearing a mask everyday all day forever and ever and ever is drastic; if you don‚Äôt think it is then we can‚Äôt even have a conversation) to prevent to few from falling victim.  This attempt to legislate positive outcomes that leave NOT ONE PERSON behind will never work and is grossly unpopular on almost every level.    

The thing that Progressives and Far-Righters don‚Äôt understand is that extreme beliefs aren‚Äôt popular and don‚Äôt rule the day.  While you can argue about how we measure IQ you cannot argue that differing levels of IQ exist along a bell curve.  The smart people will never take over society.  That‚Äôs what the Progressives want.  Won‚Äôt happen.  Too many people aren‚Äôt that kind of smart.  The people in the middle make the rules my friend.  Never going to change.  Too much pressure from the Far-Right or Far-Left will cause violence against them.  Time for everyone to wake up.

Third you try to do a childish I know you are but what am I trying to project your flaw of not recognizing statistics and probabilities when I‚Äôve already highlighted and supported that view of you.

You share your personal experience, a bit of a red herring.  Here though is mine.  I didn‚Äôt really isolate - went to movies, restaurants, etc.  I work at a place that require masks but behind my office door I wouldn‚Äôt wear and when I had a meeting I would see if they were okay but would remove our masks.

‚ÄúCOVID is a new and novel disease‚Äù i don‚Äôt think this is something many loathe to consider, I just think most people don‚Äôt think of it.  Absence of thought is not the same as a loathsome thought.

‚ÄúWe can do‚Ä¶from falling victim.‚Äù  Nice red herring rant.  You tend to get very emotional and off topic.  I see that what you are trying to do is make it seem you don‚Äôt hold the views you do by making what seems like a series of agreeable statements.  But your other statements and failure to point out failures on both sides shows your true views.

‚ÄúThis attempt to legislate positive outcomes that leave not one person behind‚Ä¶‚Äù nice fairly tale but this is not happening.  You continue to exaggerate but legislation like masks and vaccination is not attempting to leave not one person behind.  Statistically speaking it is intended to help more people.

‚Äú‚Ä¶will never work and is grossly unpopular‚Äù if you ever look at negotiations you will find that this consensus type of direction (you are advocating by looking at popularity) is not the best outcome.

Perhaps I came off as dogmatic, and I apologize if so, but I thought everyone had access to all the info we have discussed, and I‚Äôm a little puzzled that there isn‚Äôt agreement on the incontrovertible and now publicly-accepted facts that for the last few years have been labeled ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù.

Respectfully, you are mistaken on this: I did not disparage any science.  I disparaged the propaganda ‚Äúscience‚Äù that has never been true. (Edited to add: Therefore it is not really science, regardless of how much it is incessantly parroted, and non-science that is purported to be science should be disparaged, though I think that should be clear.) The ‚Äúscience‚Äù that the experts knew all along was a fraud but would not expose‚Ä¶ like masks being effective to prevent aerosolized viruses. It was always  ‚Äúdemonstrably true‚Äù that they offer negligible benefit against covid. It is also demonstrably true that there are effective treatments, which the consensus ‚Äúscience‚Äù denied and lied about, insisting none existed. Many doctors effectively used them all over the world. The evidence is there if anyone looks. I‚Äôm speaking about facts. Not opinions. (Edited to add: Do your own homework please. I don't have time to list all mine here, though some try to bully people to spend their time doing that.)

Unfortunately and tragically, it is true that many silent doctors know that what‚Äôs being done is fallacious, and their courageous colleagues who are being blackballed are confounded that they quietly play along - denying treatment and forcing mask wearing in their clinics - while their neglected patients are at home dying. (Edited to add: Does anyone care about these facts? How can this be ignored? Do the mask lovers or contentious, arrogant commenters care about this as much as dissecting peoples comments and assuming ludicrous motives to deflect from the facts? Do they care about the people who have needlessly, senselessly, cruelly died?!!! And yes, many doctors have been silenced, regardless of the superior status and character that some want to assert about them. Their own colleagues are mystified.)

With med school debt and the possibility of being fired, blackballed, and stripped of their licenses, I don‚Äôt see how doctors could afford to speak out, regardless of how adult they may be.

Reply: @@gc1438            ‚ÄúPerhaps there is a misunderstanding.‚Äù  None on my side, just you trying to move the goal posts.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say you were asked.‚Äù  A point that I acknowledged in my statement when I pointed out your ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù was just a delusion.

‚ÄúMeaning an individual seemed offended by my opinion‚Äù two problems for you here.  First you provided no evidence that someone was offended and your use of saying you felt like you were being asked to apologize was a way to exaggerate an unsubstantiated claim (and so you weren‚Äôt basing things on facts).  Second is you say it ‚Äúseemed‚Äù but as I have been able to point out, your ability to evaluate the conversation and your own words logically is not a strength of yours (at least based on this conversation) so you shouldn‚Äôt be relying on your observation to be other than emotional and biased.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like‚Ä¶opinions either, but I‚Äôm open to hear other viewpoints and any facts that might contradict mine.‚Äù  Few issues for you here.  First you don‚Äôt appear (as I‚Äôve pointed out) to use facts and evidence so your statement of ‚Äúcontradict mine‚Äù is a misstatement.  Second you getting emotional and exaggerating as I pointed out with your feeling of being asked to apologize is a technique to cut off other peoples opinions and shows you aren‚Äôt open to hearing them.  Third you used logical fallacies which at best shows you are not listening at worst it shows you are intentionally going to change what other people and you have said to fit your narrative which is a closed off technique to hearing other peoples opinions.  Your statements therefore did ignore others and tried to silence them by showing yourself to be emotional and irrational. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel persecuted per se.‚Äù. Yet your words say otherwise.  You delusionally saying you feel you need to apologize and not only that but apologizing for your highly euphemistic way of classifying your statements as if you were just sharing opinions (a tactic you are trying to repeat here without evidence to support it, another sign you are narcissistic) is you acting persecuted.

Ironically you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôve done wrong‚Äù which is a statement that expresses a feeling of persecution.  This is your problem, your words deceive you.  You try to claim one thing but then immediately contradict it in this case.

‚ÄúPerhaps I came‚Ä¶disinformation.‚Äù  Now you apologize literally when no one is asking you to apologize which again contradicts your statement that your expression was only a feeling.  In addition you claim something is ‚Äúincontrovertible‚Äù yet provide no evidence to support this.  It is not a fact, it‚Äôs an opinion.  And the use of that word is you attempting to elevate your opinion as if it is fact based, again a sign of your narcissism.

‚ÄúI did not disparage any science‚Äù. Nice lie.  You said ‚ÄúThe COVID 19 ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù always silenced the science that didn‚Äôt fit the narrative‚Ä¶‚Äù. By using quotes around consensus you are stating that you don‚Äôt believe this is the true science.  Second by saying it is a narrative you are reducing this science to be propaganda rather than something to be examined and supported perhaps.  So you very much did disparage the other science.

And you immediately acknowledge and contradict yourself by calling it ‚Äúpropaganda science‚Äù and saying falsely in a blanket statement that it has ‚Äúnever been true‚Äù and a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù.  All again without evidence.

‚ÄúLike masks being effective to prevent aerosolized viruses‚Äù nice moving of the goal posts.  You use the word prevent as a way to create an absolute when that is not what the science said, it was to limit the transmission not to prevent all transmission.  This is another sign you disparage the science because you are making up what the science was claiming so you can argue against that delusion of yours.

Then you use ‚Äúdemonstrably true‚Äù on masks and treatments yet provide no evidence which indicates it is not demonstrably true or you could have provided it.

‚ÄúThe evidence is there if anyone looks.‚Äù  Yet you are making the claim so it‚Äôs your responsible to at least give pieces of that evidence but you cannot.  Shifting the burden to someone else is again a sign of your narcissism.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm speaking about facts.‚Äù  You have yet to share a single fact with me, no evidence means no facts and you are devoid of evidence.

‚ÄúIt is true that‚Ä¶‚Äù you use these narcissistic phrases where you don‚Äôt have evidence but you try to labor something as true to pretend it is supported.  It‚Äôs not until you provide evidence.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how doctors could afford to speak out..‚Äù then you are limited in your thinking.  First it is the very calling of theirs as doctors to support public health.  Second with so many on the side of wanting other solutions, they could have made tons of money by being an alternative voice.  Third doctors and science are driven by discovery so being able to promote something counter to common belief is what brings accolades.

‚ÄúBelittling and accusing over intelligent points made.‚Äù  Nice lie.  I didn‚Äôt belittle nor accuse.  I provide evidence based information based on your statements.  You are upset by them but your inability to refute them provide credence to them.

‚ÄúYou seem to think pretty highly of yourself.‚Äù  No more than a typical person.  Again you are avoiding what I have said because you cannot refute it and you are trying to use a projection and ad hominem to deflect your flaw onto me in a desperate attempt to make it seem like you made a point, but this is just your emotional rant.

‚ÄúThe theories seem to be coming true.  Facts are facts.‚Äù  One more narcissistic statement by claiming you have facts or truth when you have presented no evidence of this.  You just keep repeating it to desperately hope someone will believe it.

‚ÄúThe red herrings seem to work more on your favor‚Äù now you do a childish and unsupported attempt at projecting your flaw of illogical statements onto me.  It‚Äôs like you are saying ‚ÄúI know you are. It what am I.‚Äù  Yet you couldn‚Äôt refute the logical fallacies I pointed out in your statements.  You can try to deflect but it‚Äôs not going to work.

Reply: @@gc1438 I see you edited one comment - that‚Äôs also a bit narcissistic as you try to improve how you are perceived.

‚ÄúI will continue to communicate with you.‚Äù  So now this is almost like a threat.  I will tell you, you continue to posting or you not tells me what I have already said about you.

‚ÄúUnless you continue with your red herrings‚Ä¶‚Äù yet you have no evidence I have committed a red herring.  You introduce the topic of feeling you were asked to apologize, you introduced your supposed following of all evidence, etc.  And it is that which I‚Äôm responding to.  So my comments are very much on point .

‚ÄúAnalyzing strangers behaviors‚Äù here is your weak attempt to claim I couldn‚Äôt possibly understand you yet note how you cannot refute a thing I said.  If you truly had an issue that you could present evidence that I was wrong, you would have done it and in three posts and one edit, you couldn‚Äôt.  And note how hypocritical you are because I commented to you because you were going off topic by using ad hominems rather than address what the other person said and projecting your flaws onto them.

‚ÄúAscribing perceived motives‚Äù same as my last comment, you say this to act like I couldn‚Äôt possibly be right with some disgust, but note how you haven‚Äôt refuted what I have said.  That would be much more powerful but you didn‚Äôt do it.

‚ÄúInstead of addressing actual facts with contradicting ones‚Äù two problems for you here.  You haven‚Äôt presented any facts, no evidence to support your opinions.  The other problem is that I am using evidence, I have evidence of your narcissism for instance and I have quoted to show where that narcissism exists.  Those quotes are evidence.  Sorry but this is just another projection of your own flaw onto others.

I think this represents a majority of your opinion topic areas.  I also will point out you didn‚Äôt provide one piece of evidence for these and therefore they are just unsubstantiated opinion.  Now the rule is that I can dismiss an opinion as wrong with as much evidence as was used to present it, in this case none.  So I will dismiss each of these by saying your absolute statements are not true.  But I will give you an opportunity to try to present evidence to let‚Äôs say three of these items (I don‚Äôt want just one because you may cherry pick so I am asking for you to provide evidence for a third of them).  We‚Äôll see how you do.

Reply: @@wawabbit I worked for 3M and I know the science behind the N95 respirators (sometimes referred to as "masks" by the general public). N95s offer highly effective protection, when worn properly, by filtering out  95% of airborne, microbial, and inert particles to 0.3 microns. 3M developed a proprietary technology to electrostatically charge the N95 microfiber filter media which captures airborne particulates and also makes it easier to breathe through them. Other manufacturers are now entering the market with N95 respirators, further widening the pool of available respirators to the general consumer. 3M‚Äôs N95 respirators are NIOSH certified (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) for efficacy. All legitimate N95 respirators must be certified by NIOSH and should be labeled as such on the respirator itself and the packaging. The federal government is also providing NIOSH certified N95s gratis to Americans through a nationwide distribution program.

The point is mandates aren‚Äôt strict enough to be effective although they could be, and people are refusing to follow them anyway then claiming masks ‚Äúare clearly useless‚Äù like that makes any sense. Also the effectiveness of different types of masks has changed depending on different variants. Omicron is WAY more easily transmissible than other variants that came before it which is why we started using N95s and disposables. Also what if you are asymptomatic and you go out without a mask because you have no idea you‚Äôre infected? That‚Äôs the whole point. I felt fine when I went to Ash Wednesday services, but I still wore a mask because it was literally the day after Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and there were elderly people in church. If it‚Äôs even possible to reduce the chance of giving covid to someone with a weaker immune system than mine, I‚Äôll do it. And it‚Äôs not a big deal, either. I can‚Äôt believe people are really complaining about having their lives ‚Äúruined‚Äù when over a million people have died from covid.

It is time for people like you to start apologizing for being wrong for two years, not time to double down on nonsensical thinking patterns.

And then another fake emotional emoji hiding what your words have conveyed throughout that you are hurt, embarrassed and frustrated.  And all that after you came on here feeling so confident, to leave with such shame has to be mortifying.

Reply: I read through most of the comments here and the only argument I see about face masks is that they aren't effective at filtering out the virus, but this is a bit flawed. It seems like people expect masks to be an impenetrable barrier when that was never the case, they are meant to mitigate exposure. While the virus cells themselves are smaller than what the mask can filter, they are often attached to molecules of water in the air that masks can and do filter. So, yes they actually do stop, not all, but many virus cells from getting into you. Also the fact seems to be glossed over that masks limit the projection of particles via breathing, coughing, & sneezing. So when you do those things, the particles don't go as far and have a lesser chance of making it to someone's nose or mouth. A quick Google search will link to you many credible studies done on this, do yourself a favor stay away from biased news sources like Fox News and CNN. Find truly unbias news outlets and get your facts from there (AP, npr, BBC, etc...).

The undisputable best way to not get Covid is to stay home, it's true, but unfortunately that option was not available for everyone. Obviously going to restaurants is optional, but people still had to go to work, or the doctors, etc... For others to say masks didn't help is just irresponsible and dangerous. I think a lot of people argued against masks like they were supposed to be a cure, which was never the case. It was just a tool to help us get by and lower the spread while the vaccine was being developed.

Reply: @@MsMars. to deny children the in-person education they need and deserve, when they were never the ones at high risk was wrong.  There was never any evidence that kids were getting COVID from schools and plenty of evidence that kids were getting it from their own family members or from friends and classmates outside of schools.  In the other hand, there was plenty of evidence around the world and in states that opened schools early on, that schools, when using preventive measures like masks and distancing, were safe and that any ‚Äúmitigating risks factors‚Äù were quickly overridden by the loss of education, harm to their mental health and the lack of social and emotional resources many kids receive at schools.  To make children pay such a high price - especially after the vaccines for adults came out in winter/spring of 2021 was wrong and many parents will never forget that.

Reply: @@gc1438      ‚ÄúYou really don't know me.‚Äù  Except your patterns you follow in your comments give me enough evidence to know you fairly well.  And we know this because you haven‚Äôt been able to refute a thing I have said.  You have been mad and emotional about them, but you haven‚Äôt been able to point out with any support that my comments are wrong.

‚ÄúAnd I really do hear you.‚Äù  Nice strawman, you cannot help but be illogical to defend your fragile nature.  Note how I said this statement was part of the game you are now pretending to play seeing your first few approaches haven‚Äôt worked.  Note how you don‚Äôt deny that it was part of a game and was consistent with what I said.

‚ÄúAnd I have sadness for you.‚Äù  Another unoriginal, unsupported and childish ‚ÄúI know you are but what am I‚Äù type response from you.  You have had to lie, use logical fallacies, pretend you were leaving the conversation only to not have enough self esteem to stick to it, project your flaws and be childish (and that‚Äôs likely not all).  These actions of yours deserve sadness but nothing of my comments fall into that category.  You are desperately projecting.

‚ÄúThere is so much more to life in learning from others and seeing the beauty of diverse opinions, without ever having to agree.‚Äù  If this is directed at me, then it‚Äôs a strawman because I never have said or done anything to the contrary.  It is also a feeble attempt to act like you are taking a high road that you never took.  You started in this thread rejecting any counter opinions and being very close minded.  And when you received a simple challenge for you to support your unsubstantiated claims, you crumbled.  So while you can type these words, you don‚Äôt live or approach things according to this ideal.

‚ÄúWe are each uniquely made and do not interact the same way, and that is something to treasure and explore, rather than assuming we think identically and can therefore definitively assume motives, which often cannot be further from the truth.‚Äù  Another strawman and one that shows you either don‚Äôt get it or want to desperately ignore how I know you.  I know you not because you have the same thinking as I do, not because you interact the same way, etc.  I know you because I have done studies on people like you and you follow the pattern of those people.  I will call you the ‚Äúonline snowflakes‚Äù.  My ability to predict what you would do and my ability to properly call out what and why you were doing things (which you have not once been able to refute) is from careful consideration and observation.  

‚ÄúIt can be really isolating and lonely to belittle and denigrate others when they are boldly and confidently standing in their convictions, which are firmly rooted in fact, that anyone else can pursue.‚Äù  Nice set of lies you have here.  First I haven‚Äôt belittled or denigrated you.  That is an exaggerated emotional response.  I have simply pointed out what the evidence shows.  You don‚Äôt like that evidence but it‚Äôs not me belittling or denigrating (there is a difference that you seem to be oblivious to).  Second my very participation in this thread is not isolating at all.  I engage in conversations where someone like you runs from them and it‚Äôs your actions that are isolating you  Third not so much a lie but as you just admitted you are standing in your convictions which shows that your belief that you are open minded was a lie.  Fourth you stating they are facts when you cannot produce a single one is a lie as well.  Fifth you continuing to shift your burden to back up your claim is the lie that it is someone else‚Äôs job, no it is yours.

‚ÄúI didn't say before that I was done.‚Äù  Nice lie.  You said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been real‚Äù after exclaiming we weren‚Äôt getting anywhere.  That is a statement signing off of the conversation and is equivalent to ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù.

‚ÄúI only expressed that it was a fruitless endeavor.‚Äù  No, you also said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been real‚Äù which is saying goodbye.

‚ÄúEven so, I attempt to show love by persevering with people who ridicule and attack, just as I was loved and pursued by God, even when I was His enemy.‚Äù  Again this false attempt by you to act like you‚Äôve taken some high road.  Unfortunately when you lie, when you use logical fallacies, when you project your flaws and blame others (as you are doing right here) for things they didn‚Äôt do, that is not you on a high road, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.  And more lies because I haven‚Äôt attacked, I haven‚Äôt ridiculed, your emotional state made you respond as if that happened when all I did was point out evidence, but that‚Äôs a you problem, not something I did.  And note how I have responded to your blame, your illogical statements and lies, I take them in stride.  I don‚Äôt get emotional, I don‚Äôt act persecuted, I just understand the emotional state you are in.

‚ÄúBut I am done now, as my husband thinks it's time, and he's right!‚Äù  So this is your second time claiming you are done.  I guess we‚Äôll see if your fragile ego can handle it.  You know how someone without a fragile ego finishes an online conversation, they just leave without posting again.  They have no need to exclaim they are leaving because exclaiming you are leaving has two hopeful end results for you.  One is preferred which is it gets the other person to not respond with the thought of why bother.  The other is that they can post one last illogical and lie filled comment and pretend they don‚Äôt have to see the proper corrections and critiques to their misstatements.  

‚ÄúI thank you for sharing your ideas and firmly standing on what you believe to be the truth.‚Äù  Again a lie.  You to this point don‚Äôt have any idea which side I stand on, that‚Äôs the irony here.  I wasn‚Äôt on a side except the side of logic.  I saw you say illogical things and I called them out, I wasn‚Äôt taking a side on the overall issue and you completely missed that which shows you weren‚Äôt listening.

‚ÄúI hope you, and all others, will pursue truth. The truth is what will "set you free"... and leads to life and light!‚Äù  I think there is a passage that says something about you worried about a splinter in someone else‚Äôs eye when you have a timber in your own.  Your false high road doesn‚Äôt work when you look at the comments you made to so many others including me.  You didn‚Äôt choose to pursue truth as you lied, used logical fallacies, and made up false facts.

‚ÄúHint: Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."‚Äù  Another ironic item because you casting blame on others is not the way of Jesus, you lying is breaking a commandment.  So again a suggestion by you that you don‚Äôt follow.

Reply: You guys clearly haven't done any reading on the topic. If you did you'd know that while deadly , covid is very considerate. It's like a cease-fire during war. It will viciously and relentlessly pursue you. In the car , in the parking lot. At the entrance of the building. But once you get to your table , you are essentially signing a temporary treaty. Which automatically ends when you get up from your table. The more you know , right?

The only masks that would actually function as a three pronged approach with self isolation and social distancing. And even then they need to be swapped out at most weekly. 

And if they actually gave people the financial resources TO self isolate.. the whole thing was a cluster fuck and they are still low key tryna cling to it

Reply: No. Wearing a mask at least part of the time is better than not at all. 
  
What you're saying is like saying if we can pee in the bathroom at the restraunt then why not on the way there too? 
  
The riskiest portion of spreading covid to the most people is during the walk to the table as you come in proximity to the most people during that period. Once at the table you're distanced from them and they should have a mask on should they approach your table.

Reply: Tell me you couldn't sit through the whole video to see the point they were making before getting "pissed off.. so much". Nothing like getting emotional and pissed off without even finishing the thing you're watching and then ranting about it. You can disagree all you want, but you can't even watch the whole thing or critically think about crap you just watched. The champions of freedom and truth can't finish five minute videos without getting "pissed off so much". Meanwhile they'll listen to Rogan tell them what to believe, and tell other people to do their own research. Shit is hilarious to watch all sides of this argument point at each other and yell about how the other is all propaganda when they can't even finish a clip without getting emotional about it.

Comment: So like, a month ago, literally everyone living close to me got it.  All at the same time.  Lady next door almost died.  Me and mine, we got vaxxed.  I was glad my neighbors got better.  I really did like my mask with roses on it, tho.  Still have it on my desk.  Edit here:  Oh lord I have to edit because some people don't understand that a person can have their desk in their home, in their bedroom, and are just looking for a reason to trash someone.   Sorry for not being so super specific for the perfect ones.  I will have to remember the smallish size of some brains.  Which is difficult because I tend to give people the benefit of a doubt.  LOL

I will never forgive Democrats for this. While they allowed mega-corporations to steal market share, we had to shut down temporarily, then permanently, due to this extreme overreaction.

It was disheartening to see many young people, who tend to question everything, not allowing each other to have different opinions. This was a lesson as to how easy it is for the government and media to divide us and no matter our politics, we should all be worried.

Questioning authority is the easy part, but do you know yourself well enough to actually be able to challenge it? I don‚Äôt listen to people who sit on a high horse about their own intelligence, waiting for everyone to trust them. Oh I‚Äôve done far more questioning than you‚Äôll ever do.

Reply: @@emblemblade9245 it's not about "authority" it's about the studies in the beginning that showed cloth and paper masks showed no statistical difference in stopping the virus. That N95 was the only safe way to go, but no one wanted to hear it or listen. So they went about their business with inferior masking and likely spread COVID much worse. Bad things happen when you allow yourself to be in a bubble and don't let new information in out of fear. Doesn't matter what side you're on, you should be able to have discussions and speak your mind.

Comment: I just wish my anti-vax friend could see this as her two favorite things in life were SNL and her Tesla. Unfortunately, she decided to go from Florida to Vegas in her Tesla, which meant hanging out in cafes for hours while recharging over the 3-day trip, and on her first day in Vegas she tested positive then died a couple weeks later.

I have learned that the left can be just as batshit crazy as the right. And regular folks themselves can be just as contradictory and irresponsible as the government that rules them.

Reply: aguyfromnothere OP was obviously not suggesting such a thing since the loons in OP‚Äôs examples were people who disregard commonly accepted scientific ideas that most people don‚Äôt have a problem with. Thus those same kind of ‚Äúoppose the establishment‚Äù people in covid talks were the loons.

But that‚Äôs fine, because only a loon twists one person‚Äôs funny comment into an opposite meaning to make it about their problems that they‚Äôre too fragile to handle themselves. I can rest easy tonight knowing that even a witless person like me has more of it than you.

Yet you twitter warriors had to virtue signal and tell other people to wear their masks or they werent a good person.

Etc... No drama, no hatred. Following the stupid rule while discussing the stupidity of the rule.

Reply: I hated outdoor dining.  My expensive phone was stolen when I turned my head back for no more than three seconds.  I know, I should not have put it on the table.  I guess I am luckier than that guy on the news whose expensive gold watch was stolen while he was eating.   Not to mention that sometimes the weather was cold and the wind made my food cold in about three minutes.  Oh, well, at least I had food!! I think any day that we have enough to eat and shelter and friends is a wonderful day.  God bless all of you, and take care of yourselves.  We all have sad stories, but we get stronger when we show respect for each other, and focus on the positive accomplishments, which we all have.  At least I will tell my grandchildren some day, "I survived the corona virus pandemic of 2020!!!"

Reply: @@jayfaraday1176  Basic fact at this point is that the masks and mandates and the vaccine have all accomplished nothing. They haven‚Äôt saved many people if any, the vaccine has shown to have as low as a 30-40% efficacy rate across the board, and the Johnson and Johnson has been shown to have a 3% efficacy rate. Masks don‚Äôt actually stop the virus from getting through unless you have a KN95 mask, which the vast majority of people don‚Äôt. The biggest factor determining covid contraction, symptoms, and survival, is weight. Obesity is the number one deadliest comorbidity with covid. And all of this applies to people that voted for trump or Biden. Not to mention Biden so incredibly spineless that Iran and Russia have both made big power moves since he took office, moves that they were too scared to make when Trump was in office. Sorry Trump was mean on Twitter though I know that can be traumatic. Get some perspective bud

Reply: @@lanetower3411  you can say ‚Äúif‚Äù all day long. The fact remains, Trump started exactly zero new wars, and gave up nothing to the Taliban, or Russia, or North Korea, or China. Biden however handed the Taliban a country and an arsenal, and is standing by while Russia takes over Ukraine, and has pandered nonstop to communist China. He is, at best, senile and incompetent for the role of president. At worst, he thinks America is a terrible country and is trying to tear it down as best he can while he‚Äôs in office. I tend to assume the best in people so I‚Äôm leaning towards incompetent. But there‚Äôs a reason we have all time high inflation rates and insane national debt and look like weenies on the world stage, and I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs not due to Trump who isn‚Äôt in office of any kind.

Reply: @Vinista Actually, mask mandates WERE effective.  Several countries and US states did comparative studies between regions with and without mask mandates.  It was demonstrated that mask mandated areas had fewer hospitalizations and deaths than those without.  And this is even when one understands that the mandates allowed for different kinds of masks with different behaviors (like mask touching and hand washing).
The whole point of the mandates were to decrease the transmission of COVID in order to not clog up medical facilities.  This allowed time for the medical facilities to treat everyone.  And it DID help.

Comment: Why question mask usage? Do people not realize hospital workers wear masks and had a much lower infectivity rate despite seeing severely sick COVID patients for two years? With previous variants, cloth masks were fine. With Omicron, KN95 and N95 were needed instead. Why still joke about an all-or-nothing "diD We nEeD mAsKs" at all. There was different variants with different mutations over the past 2 years. The second half of this skit lacks any intellectual sophistication.

The washing hands and scrubbing surfaces bit was theater though. No public cases of COVID from surfaces occurred outside of theoretical and lab situations. It was primarily a respiratory virus in air particles.

Comment: The problem is the fact that we collectively refuse to agree to outlaw animal ownership and police ourselves from it..

We refuse to address the quality problem, so we are obviously going to go around in circles... This is something and diligent recovered addict can comprehend...

Half measures are an irrational coping strategy with unsustainable lifestyle choices...

How is "I'll just eat animal products on the weekend" any different than an alcoholic saying "I'll just drink on the weekends..

I was an alcoholic.. I DID that compartmentalization..
I know the face of addiction.. I understand the value of logic and reason .. more so than my own personal "intuition"..

Because that is what separates an adult (brain) from a childs brain.

The suspension of belief that is required to ignore our animal product addiction is the prefrontal cortex (placebo/nocebo effect) which is exactly what allows us to choose to do so in the first place..

Life is a lovely paradox like that.. tho objectively describable and explainable, subjectively impossible to have any way to control or grasp.

You don't refuse to stop needlessly exploiting animals for personal gain, and then blame the resulting inevitable pandemic presence on hand washing and vaccine availability..

The reason I don't agree with the vaccine is because it is used to protect overweight, overentitled affluent people from the results of their unsustainable choices..

Like spoiled rich children they want to abuse science to continue with their functional addiction to animal exploitation and consumption.

It's tough being an adult in a society of people who are addicted to abusing animals when you don't.

It's tough walking around knowing everyone is choosing this way forward..

It's even harder knowing many KNOW that and still think to employ half measures.. knowing half measure condemn other people to suffering and will still catch up with them.

Vaccines won't save our species from our own self inflicted problems. Well.. it'll save the overtitled f*t ****s with money, I guess.. for a while.

Comment: None of the Covid policy made sense. We have hundreds of mask efficacy studies in terms of respiratory disease spread. They don‚Äôt matter. And going all in on new medical tech with zero long term safety data was suicidally stupid. Good luck with your knee jerk reactions

It's a serious topic and it's so, so terrible that people are dying and getting very sick, and this sketch OR this comment don't take away from that. This was a video made to make people laugh, and a comment made to compliment said sketch.

Reply: @@jaimhaas5170 what? No, the mandates are a good thing, life-saving, but the REAL problem comes from when people think that as long as they walk in somewhere with a mask only to take it off is fine. Like, the mandates keep people from dying, they shouldn't take the mask off when they get inside, which is the issue.

The reason people no longer wear gloves in public--some people were early on--is because we learned that surfaces weren't a significant source of COVID spread. People who have COVID breathing and talking in close proximity are.

In other words, it's not about what people "want," it's what affects the spread and what doesn't.

Even my autistic cousin got that. He has sensory issues. He solved that by finding a variety of ways to rarely have to be in situations where masking would be necessary. He took responsibility for his own issues instead of throwing tantrums about not being able to do whatever he wanted. Unfortunately, my uncle (his father) almost died from COVID, anyway, because other people weren't so careful.

You don‚Äôt know why someone doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine. Maybe they had a bad reaction to the first one and their doctor told them not to get another one. Or maybe they are allergic to something in the vaccine. Or maybe they‚Äôve already had Covid and are immune. Yet you‚Äôre judging ppl based on that alone. Then you have the audacity to accuse others of playing ‚Äúgotcha,‚Äù when that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre doing with your ‚Äúholier-than-thou‚Äù attitude! It‚Äôs ridiculously juvenile.

Reply: @@Paddyo875 You act like there's a good way to deal with a disease like this.  You're playing mitigation.  You sequester everyone over 40 for 8 weeks then encourage everyone else to go about their business trying to cut down on vectors of transmission while trying to reach herb immunity before it mutates.  The shutdown itself killed 100,000 YOUNG people in increased ODs in 2 years, alone.  (Which is probably more life-years than all the old people that died.)  Undiagnosed cancers, increase in diabetes, skyrocketing heart-disease, skyrocketing suicides, 2 year wasted in school in poorer districts.

Again:
There is no, no, logical reason for killing someone's livelihood and social standing if they have natural immunity with no jab.  That seemed to be absolute and pure SADISM from politically deluded scoundrels.

Comment: Proper use of masks probably made a difference. I have worn a mask at work every day for the past since this happened. I like to wear a mask in public because I don't like my face. I haven't been sick once since I started wearing a mask. My job requires me to wash my hands a LOT. I also don't care about being vaccinated because part of me wants to use a sick day. I've never gotten a flu vaccine and I've only had the flu once in my life. I had a fever of 103 F and I was told I still needed to come to work because no one could cover for me (maybe a decade before covid). I don't know what the point is except that I just want to wear my masks forever now.

Reply: @@elianad2083 You take it off to eat. As long as you don't talk while chewing that's still ~90% as effective as masking full time. Aerosols aren't magic, they are only made when wet things shake around *like your voice box and lips when you're talking.* A small number of droplets are generated when the entrance to your lungs opens and closes, but otherwise just breathing and eating makes almost none.

Comment: Kansas is a perfect example of mask mandates working. Some counties in Kansas imposed mask mandates and some did not. Those that did not saw exponentially more cases of COVID than those that did not. People who went to events unmasked generally got COVID at higher rates. Funny sketch, but bullshit premise.

yes, tested on morons who took an untested MRNA concoction. Its the results that will STILL take years to determine its safety and efficacy. If the dozens of athletes that dropped dead on sports fields all around the world and the tens of thousands with bells palsy are any indication, then I guess your up the creek, huh....  Next time maybe less on the smug and more on the intelectual curiosity.  Maybe they will find a way to get it out of your body, but I doubt it.

Comment: Fauci and company did a GREAT JOB covering up the genocide on black, brown, and elderly people in NYC exposed by the nurse whistleblower Erin Marie Olszewski documentary with Video and Test evidence. Big Ups to everyone in the media covering up with Fauci what happened to black people especially in NYC, Doctors need those indirect payments from taxes.

They‚Äôre too half-witted to realize this is just another case of them taking some recent awkward event and making it comedic. Concluding there‚Äôs an agenda behind it is just a reflection of their own ignorance and desperation to be validated. And they must be desperate, considering they keep trolling the comments on these videos despite claiming that the show hasn‚Äôt been funny for decades. Losers.

Listen to scientist & doctors and although they don‚Äôt have shit figured out right away, trust them more than you trust Fox News and memes on facebook. I wore a mask and avoided Covid from day one. A few weeks ago i caught it because my anti mask brother-in-law decided to not tell us he had. Now I‚Äôm dealing with health issues while he is perfectly fine.

Then again, considering how much they do love to salt liberals (do you even watch the weekend update?), the fact that y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt noticed by now means you don‚Äôt even know what liberal means anymore, if you ever did. They‚Äôre just your omnipresent boogeyman that‚Äôs always paradoxically one step behind you and yet somehow a big enough threat to your well-being that you need to constantly try to assure yourselves how much smarter you are than them. Weird how that is. I guess these liberals are nothing more than a mirror for you to shine your pretty perfect faces up against, like it‚Äôs a daily routine. Though I don‚Äôt really understand how you can enjoy being so ignorant while also gleefully looking for everything liberals say so you can compare yourselves against them. Oh well, try not to trip with all that mirror-gazing, you might hurt someone

I am vaxxed and boosted.  I caught it a month after boosting and only had the sniffles and a headache for a day.  I have a friend who still considers it all fake even after being hospitalized when his oxygen count plummeted from it.  He recovered and is still out there claiming it is all fake, he is an idiot.   The bottom line is the vax should be a purely individual decision with no restrictions or stigma attached.

they refused to do their part for society, they shouldn't be allowed to be apart of it. if that hurts your feelings then too the fuck bad. society doesn't deserve to be abused by people that can't even do the bare minimum when the need arises. you don't get to just leech off of society when it suits you and then refuse to engage when shit doesn't go your way.
if you want total freedom then go live in the woods, if you want to live with everyone else then you need to do the bare minimum to keep as many people as possible safe.
it's like propping up someone that stabbed someone else. no they are destructive to society and as such they get removed from said society. 
if everyone had done their part instead of whining this shit would of been over a year ago and the number of deaths would only be a fraction of what they currently are.

You can't reverse it, like how you can take off a mask if you need to.  A forced, or coerced injection is not "the bare minimum."  Those would be things like avoiding large gatherings, staying home if you have symptoms, and testing.  You will get push back from pressuring others to get injected with a brand-new vaccine.  Especially one with relatively little clinical vetting.

Comment: Thank you for reminding me how confusing this whole thing has been for so many people.  I was raised in a scientifically and medically literate family, so for me, it's always been very simple: DO ALL THE THINGS and don't let wishy-washy/flip-floppy governmental departments or politicians tell me what's "OK" or what isn't, and when.  I decided for myself that all-the-things are always OK, and I will be masking up for at least the next 60 days.  I think the CDC fucked up royally this week, and I believe we're just headed for another spike.  Those truckers and their families/friends/supporters are why.  Even the ones that are secretly vaccinated - immunity wanes over time, and it's obvious they'll never get boosted nor keep up with their shots over time.  Prepare for a new variant at any time now, and it just might be deadly enough to make all the vaccines/boosts useless.  That's the problem and that's why the CDC had no moral or ethical right to make the choices they made this week.  And that's why I don't listen to them anymore.  I just follow the science and what I know of the human body, and keep myself safe, PERIOD.

Reply: @@brittgayle467 It absolutely does something regardless of it not being 100% effective, but the question is do the benefits outweight the consequences. For many it has negatively effected their lives which is why there is doubt in the vaccine. Plain and simple terms, medical decisions should be a personal decision between individuals and their physicians and others should respect that. Not all vaccines behave the same for each person so it should not be a blanket statement that everyone should just get it. As a medical professional for the last 4 years I see more data than most Americans, and can tell you that COVID direct deaths simply dont exist, people die from other medical conditions, some of which have been exasperated by COVID, but most didn't matter that they had COVID. COVID related deaths reported just means that the person had COVID in their blood at the time of death. COVID is real, but the fear the media has pushed is overexaggerated.

Even if you were or are a physician (which I dont believe), you would know that blanket statements like everyone should be vaccined to save lies is a lie in itself and terribly dangerous to say to people. When people die from a heart attack their cause of death is directly related to the heart attack as opposed to covid because heart attack deaths are also being reportedas "covid related" when they have covid at the same time. I know you're full of crap to say youre a physician and yet not recognize the truth that our covid fear is blown out of proportion as hospitalizations are about even across the board between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with more repeat cases of covid being those who were vaccinated.

Are you not aware that anyone making comments on YT has to call things by different names in order to not be censored when saying anything anti-jibjab? This has been the life of facism to those that speak against the narrative. So those who have not lived in a cave know the alt words used in order to screw with AI censorship. I have never in my life seen so many uneducated lemmings accepting false narratives that they have not even researched or actually read. The "science" was only partially released in December and it shows a bad product. CDC even admits natural immunity is better than the vax. But when you point out their hero CDC is  now backtracking...no one can fathom that they were lied to.

And even the CDC now agrees on many of the points that anti jibjabbers were talking about because studies were conducted.

Reply: @Peary_Legal You obviously did NOT read the FDA safety trial data which is NOT an insert. It was the safety trial data submitted to the FDA for approval. It took a long court order to release it to the public because they wanted to keep you from reading it for 50 years. We will get the rest of the data by September.  You need an education and those shock treatments you mentioned. Why? Because 1) you are ignorant and refuse to read....and 2) your random projection and gaslighting is something  that says more about you than me.

Reply: @@78TBGAMER did you read the report that was finally given in Dec. after a court order released it? It is the first part of a long report starting with the words "adverse effects". The rest will be distributed by Sept. The report has 1/4 of the participant's data missing. We do not even know if they died or what happened to them. Furthermore 2.9% of the participants died as opposed to .08% dying with no vax. Furthermore the side effects were serious and amounted to 1/3 of the partipants... most of whom did not recover after 3 months when the trial stopped. This holds strong with testimonies of vax injuries. Lastly the CDC states that the vax is only good for 3 months and that natural immunity is better than the vax. That the vaxed transmute the virus 16x more than unvaxed and even are now dying at close rate of unvaxed. Also...the vax has little efficacy towards omicron as it is a different virus altogether...which was also created in a lab. The stats are on the CDC site as well as that trial data I mentioned. These are facts. If you still think that those are good odds or is a good product...than we interpret math differently. Not only that...but the UK did a study to find out how many people died of covid alone...no cormorbities. It was roughly only 17,000 in all of UK and Ireland in the ENTIRE 2 YEARS! which means that these folks died mostly from comorbidities. Oh...and they found the average age of deaths was over 80. In other words...we have been lied to. Not only that but a freedom of info act asked the NIH for a report on the cause of this pandemic and it was returned completely blacked out.

Reply: @@resonancewaves9659 The original jab is less effective than it was (but still helpful) because of new variants. That's why we have the booster jab. It just tops up what the original jabs were already doing. That's how vaccines work. The same thing happens with the flu jab - that's why vulnerable people have to get a new flu jab every year. This is nothing new. And the jab will still have saved many, many lives (and still will be saving some).

Reply: @@resonancewaves9659 also, most people who died had comorbidities because being already medically vulnerable means Covid is more likely to kill you. Most of these people wouldn't have had premature deaths without Covid, because their conditions are carefully managed. Covid still killed them.

Imagine you have two people, one with weak lungs, another with healthy lungs. A psychopath captures them and holds each of them underwater for one minute. The person with strong lungs can hold their breath and survives; the other cannot, and drowns. Now imagine if the psychopath stands in the dock in court and says "I didn't kill that person by holding them underwater; they already had weak lungs. Having weak lungs killed them. It only counts as murder if they drown and didn't have any existing health conditions."

The reason the person in the example was susceptible to drowning was because their body was no equipped to deal with the threat. The psychopath is still responsible for their death; he killed them by holding them underwater. Similarly, the reason people with comorbidities died when they caught Covid is because their bodies were not equipped for the threat of Covid. They would still be alive if they hadn't caught it. Covid still killed them, their bodies just weren't able to fight it as well as healthy bodies are.

Reply: @@resonancewaves9659 my father is the most honest person I know. He was also the oldest person to participate in the live virus trial. He did so because he wanted to make sure it was going to be safe for his grandchildren and his children. My father was a research scientist who helped create the most effective medication for herpes. He was so dedicated to his work that he accidentally gave himself herpes when accidentally experimenting with the virus because things were nowhere near as safe in the  70s as they are now. My grandfather was a microbiologist in the 40s and 50s. I come from a long line of dedicated doctors who care so much about people. When my grandfather was dying the nurse who cared for him with the grandchild of a woman whose life he saved when she was a child. This nurse insisted on coming in on her day off on the day my grandfather died so she could help care for him and give him the best quality of care while he died. This is the kind of person that does this kind of research for these medicines. My grandfather provided this woman with free care even though the cost of it would‚Äôve been $200,000 in today‚Äôs money. My grandfather saved this child‚Äôs life so that her great grandchild could take care of him in the hospital while he died.

 My father was the type of man that if one of his patients got sick in the middle of the night he would go in on his nights off to make sure they were OK. My dad is a stomach doctor. He‚Äôs 100% did not have to go in. But he fucking cares. These are the types of doctors and nurses who are working so hard and spending months away from their families to save the lives of people who think it‚Äôs fake. If my dad thought for a second that any of this was not real or would damage his grandson for me his only daughter he would tell us. He intentionally didn‚Äôt find out the people running the medication trials until after he had been vaccinated and the vaccine trial had been over for months.because he didn‚Äôt want knowing The scientist researching the medicine to affect giving him what medication In the double blind study. That‚Äôs where both patient and doctor don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs being given if it‚Äôs a placebo or the actual medication until the study is over so that that way we have a true consistent result..

It makes you the kind of person who is willing to argue with false narrative and overlook the truth of the situation even if it means the death of people and that makes you a terrible person. I hope the reality is you‚Äôre just stupid because the alternative means you‚Äôre going to hell so I‚Äôm just gonna pray because the alternative is terrifying for all these people saying what you say because Hell is gonna get real crowded

Reply: @@jagotiberan2181 what I said is that key words are flagged through AI. Any mention of the report name...gets taken down. Any key words....gets taken down. That has nothing to do misinformation. Forwarding folks to the CDC and the newly released FDA trial data of Phiiiizer apparently gets you deplatformed, comments taken down and the like. I think it is quite interesting that no one can post the name of that report!!!! Try it! See what happens. I merely post the name...and it is immediately gone. So I did an experiment. I made comments limiting the name each time to see what would happen. It is a long name. The numbers and certain words were censored. I was left with barely anything. So I had to make comments using no numbers and just one word each on every comment. That was the only way to tell people how to find it. Furthermore...no MSM ever reported about the supreme court decision (and yes these stations are paid by Phiiizer). You cannot access the report only by PDF and it is hard to find. It isnt an article you can just go and read. It requires downloading. Furthermore we do not have the full report. Just the safety part. We will not get the full science that screwed our lives over until September. Do you know how dumb a person has to be to take a product that the science data is not even revealed yet? How dumb a person has to be to take a jibjab that only lasts 3 months and you still get sick and die from it? That has a 16x more chance of transference? That has a 2.9% deathrate and lacking 1/4 the data on? That causes permanent illness in an originally healthy person? I could go on and on. The CDC stated the jibjabbed were dying despite being jibjabed and that natural immunity is better than the jibjab. Let me repeat that again for your noggin. THE CDC STATED THAT NATURUAL IMMUNITY IS STRONGER THAN THE JIBJAb. That is in congruence with the trial data. So why take it when you get sick anyway (a triple jibjab teacher friend I know under 3 months fought for her life recently having been sick TWO times. Meanwhile her family that was unjabbied WITH preexisiting conditions did well. Mild cold. I could go on and on. The only misinformation that is spread is the censorship of the data that FDA fought hard to keep from us for 50 years. Page 7 table 1 says it all. Now new data has come out revealing that the jibjab actually changes D N A. This use to all be conspiracy theory and now the studies are rolling out. Are you aware that 17,000 doctors were censored, had their licenses taken away and were threatened for not agreeing with the narrative? In other words...the public may be silent...but it knows. That is why Phiiizer cannot sell it's poison anymore. We know...and we are the majority. The public has lost ALL trust for these agencies.

Reply: I have not worn a mask for any reason since April when Pennsylvania rescinded the foolish mandate and I haven't even had a common cold. I look down on all you fear mongering scaredy cats, your mask is nothing but a talisman or worse a virtue signal. Look forward to snickering at your quaint anachronism in public as the rest of us move on with our lives!

Take a look around the next time you are in a large grocery store and see how many people are actually wearing the medical grade N95 masks. Hint: not many.

Reply: @RAM FAN¬† Actually, KN95 and N95 masks have been common where I live for a while. Some events even require them and don't allow cloth or surgical masks anymore. Before that, tons of people here had already switched to the surgical-style ones over cloth masks for a long time. I don't even remember where I put my cloth masks, it's been so long since I wore any of them.

Project N95 is awesome for getting legit N95s and KN95s. Powe KN95s are really comfortable and well made for anyone who hasn't tried them.

My little one's daycare teacher came down with covid, but - she was wearing a mask, and so was he, and - no one got it, thank goodness (especially cuz he's too young for the shot...no need to share your opinion on shots, thanks). I'm grateful for the protection - clearly as we move into a new phase of covid, we need to revise things, but mask-wearing during the worst surges is kind of a no-brainer.

I am not this pseudo flower child you are envisioning (and anyway, btw, that kinda person probably wouldn't believe in masks, either, and would be arguing that vitamins and healthy living are all we need to fight covid ‚úåÔ∏è). You're also wrong - kids can most certainly get it and spread it. Earlier thinking was they couldn't, but that's been found not to be the case. Yes, it's much less risky in kids, but mine had serious respiratory issues as a baby, so hopefully you can understand why I'm cautious. Take care ‚úåÔ∏èüòÜ

Reply: @@misswendyjane4992 nope categorically untrue. And yes try to keep up. You also do realize this was an experiment (emergency use authorization experiment) that‚Äôs a fact. So you should know that lots of people got placebos as a control group. So the argument is kind of invalid from that respect at any rate. So if you aren‚Äôt a research scientist, your statement is irrelevant.

Reply: @@skdewolf7606 The placebos were done in a testing study with volunteers. Once the vaccine was rolled out to the general population everyone got the vaccine and there were no placebos - please stop spreading misinformation. 

The vast majority who have been hospitalized and died are unvaccinated. You may not like that fact but it's still a fact.
That I can still get it, feel little or no effects, and spread it to unvaccinated people who then become very ill and possibly die just confirms I made the right choice. 

Today I stopped wearing a mask in public - I'm done taking precautions to protect stubborn willfully ignorant people who refuse to get the vaccine. Time to help Darwin and nature run its course. Good luck!

Comment: You know what else had little to no effect on Covid? Further making restroom and water fountain access harder, aka restricting hydration and hygiene even more. Also, if you agree with that, you have to agree with the fact that "restrooms for customers only" is cruel and inhumane. Grow up America. If your business model relies on restricting potty access, get another business model. We are all humans.

Reply: @Carpe Diem It's a fairly straightforward comparison. Both cases in which a precautionary measure is taken to reduce the harmful impact of an event rather than prevent the event itself, and in which it is therefore beside the point to note the measure's failure to prevent the event. Saying that masks do nothing because you still sneeze is a non sequitur when the function of masks is to mitigate the effects of sneezing, not to prevent sneezing, just as it would be a non sequitur to critique seatbelts for their inability to prevent a crash.

I say this as someone boosted and who could give a rip if places still require masking.I would love to know the scientific reasoning that exempts these  SNL performers from wearing masks while they perform Saturday ,but a bunch of college or high school kids doing improv skits in the same city would be required to wear masks still.

Comment: I recently saw a graph about the 900,000 U.S. Covid deaths from the past 2 years, and it showed that on average per capita for every 1 Democratic state death (VT, MA, HI, CA) there were roughly 2 Purple state deaths (VA, WI, NC, PA) and 3 Republican state deaths (AL, OK, WV, WY). If I were a Republican Congressman in a swing District or state where there's Senate race this year, these numbers are something to be concerned about.

Reply: Or maybe the graph creator cherry picked the states that would create such a statistical outcome.  You might notice NY, a very hard hit state with a very large population, is not in the Democrat group.  Florida and Texas are not in the Republican group.
  Much of the data I've seen show little difference between states even with wildly different protocols.
   What you have there is some good ole fashioned propoghanda.
