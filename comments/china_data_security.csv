The surveillance exists to control problems, criminals, security events, for normal people going on with their honest lives, nobody will be wasting any time at all watching what you are buying in the shop, or singing to yourself in the street dears.

On average that's a million five a year. Guess how many of those people are found? Not a one. All those cameras and nobody sees nothing? That just leaves me to believe that either the cameras are not as good as they say they are which I highly doubt, or there's some pretty serious human trafficking and the cops are on the payroll. That's the only thing that would explain that many people going missing and nobody knowing where they went. Because everything you do in China is documented on some cameras somewhere.

TikTok being a app that is almost leech-like when it comes to the stuff that it collects and sends back to that country. I'm really surprised that it is not banned here in the States. And I know when Trump try to ban it everybody flip the hell out. It's like Americans could care less what sensitive information that China is collecting. As long as they get their internet fix. But that's the difference between Americans and the Chinese, Americans don't give two shits about what's going on in our country as far as the political side of it goes.

And how even if the first government using this was all benine and the best people who ever lived, absolute power corrupts absolutely. No government will stay good and kind with this much power. Especially generation after generation. Whilst there are plenty of evil people out there constantly looking for an opportunity to grab power, ultimate power over their own nation. Remember the storming of the Capitol in the USA on Jan 6th 2021? Remember the exposed plan to overthrow the government in Germany, very recently, that had already involved thousands of police and military people? Basically far-right and far-left groups in any still free country are a constant threat to its freedom and prosperity.

They believe the government, as the ultimate decision maker, always know what they are doing. I would argue that this is a tragic legacy of communism even China has well adopted capitalistic ideas.

@andrewdeen6319,"I’ve read many of these comments. Those who embrace surveillance cannot take care or provide for themselves without the state. Those who can provide for themselves just want to be left alone. No matter where you live the digital age is the best and worse thing that has happened to us Humans. All any of us want is for our kids to have a chance. Folks I miss the 80s and 90s , guess I’m a Dinosaur. There are still people alive today that can build it, grow it, hunt it, design it, and live it! I’m one of those people and I do not want to watch you. I do not want to control you. I just want to be left to my own devises and the pursuit of happiness. Hopefully democracy will prevail and be reformed. Hopefully communism will see that success and finally not live in a society of fear control.

NOW a few months later, a policeman called him and told him that he's been waited for at his house etc etc, in fact that policemen was a customer and he illegally accessed the government citizen database to find out about this guy, his address, etc, to extort him on the money he paid for the courses at the pool. so again what my friend did is not ok, but the pool management is the subject that is affected, the customers have to go the the pool to get their money back and the pool management must address police on my friend. in this case a policemen privately and illegally accessed the database and went privately,called stalked my friend and extort him on his money. that what citizen databases are subjected to.",1,2022-08-08T09:30:09Z,Ugwu5sHdnGzCUy4ASVd4AaABAg

Best not to be afraid, but to see how we can use this technology to increase security (no more danger for young girls walking home alone after a party, no more young boys being stabbed on the corners, no more drugs being sold to the young, no more gangs that are able to gang up on individuals and steal, kill and even rape.  No more bike thieves, no more break-ins, no more kidnappings, no more children being taken and killed...I don't know, I can see all sorts of good things that can be used with our surveillance data.

@orakulos8421,"It does not matter the label of those in power now (right or left) establishing the legislations and tools of the current Surveillance States throughout the world. Friends today. Enemies tomorrow. The human being carries within himself the seed of corruption and abuse of power. What  people seems not see (including current governments) is that things are already out of control and going back with this ""evolution"" is a necessity of yesterday. I will try to draw in simplistic words the trap that everyone is building without writing a book in the comment: ordinary people do not care, do not act and do not see it because ordinary people want some ""savior"" to represent them in the Government . But Mr. America is a good patriotic citizen. A family man. Every day he gets up at 6, takes the garbage out, takes his car, parks on Avenida X, walks 3 or 4 blocks and arrives at his government office. While he was on his way to vote against an obscure law designed to undermine the state, his wife was taking a Uber Taxi to the mall and his son was walking 5 or 6 blocks to school. Now, Mr. America, who had the fate of the land of the free in his decisive vote, is being blackmailed by unknown people in his office and across the streets. Mr. America fears for the life of his family because every move he, his wife and his son make is anticipated by dangerous individuals following data from all ""security"" cameras, GPS taxis, etc.  A dirty and cowardly chess. The point here is that if this system continues to evolve, whichever group takes power (including foreign governments), it will never lose power again. This technology must be destroyed. This is a war against humanity and unfortunately a nuclear case scenario may sooner or later become a survival necessity for some who are still alive.",0,2022-03-08T21:50:04Z,UgyBBqcBDCOA2gMk0bl4AaABAg

Any government can easily monitor indivisual for political reasons, and camera is not a good way. Think about Snowden, about what U.S. can do to the leader of its alliances. 3.China is trying to protect personal information. Collection and use of Personal information are more and more restricted.

@millbean13,"When the lady is talking about citizens reporting on other citizens (around 6:52) for not following rules, this has caused a big problem in China recently. The people reporting the offenses get paid a percentage of the offense they report of another person. So groups of people will go out and cause situations that result in innocent people being caught on camera committing an offense and they’re fined. I’ve heard a ton of stories about this. Like you can’t drive in the carpool lane with out passengers so someone in a car will get in front of you on the highway and either drive really slow or slam on their brakes causing the person behind them to go into the carpool lane and then the first car that caused it will take a picture of them in the carpool lane and report it. And they’ll drive around all day doing this. It’s really kind of a fucked up society with their social credit scores and all that. I think 20 years down the road once China really starts cracking down on peoples private data and personal information, citizens are gonna realize, shit maybe I don’t really like this and I don’t feel comfortable living under this.

What this little girl bought is just a random sweet dish, and of course the payment app needs to record this transaction cause this is what a payment app is for. The gov would not check it unless they specifically want information of this girl. For example, if there is an AMBER alert, then the officials are very likely to check with the payment app to trace the missing kid's footprint. In the case, it is the same as every other country using credit card. The bank would record the transaction info just as the payment app.",0,2021-11-28T14:43:25Z,UgxqOBMJC0XHvHF8McR4AaABAg

@amberinthebox4462,I think the cutest thing about mandarin is how they have pauses at certain points and to us English speaking people (cus I can only attest to that. I don't speak other languages fluently but can get by with a couple others) they sound like they're kinda confused about what they're saying. And it's just really cute. Or thinking deeply in what they're saying which makes them sound smart. Won't these people get in trouble for what they're doing... being interviewed? Nazi Germany use to hold all ur information in vaulted libraries. Lol. The cloud reminds me of that a bit but it's not every single thing u do.

@amberinthebox4462,I think what China is doing is wrong. The whole social credit system... is terrible. U dont always need big brother to ho u accountable. But people should hold themselves others especially family members responsible. And reports seem like an outlet to enforce some stuff. It's worse then nazi Germany but comparable. I feel that this is abuse of people's human rights. 💔 it is out of the line in the way they do it. At least here in America theyre private about it and it's for national security. But u have to do something that will spike making the algorithm pull u up and then u get watched but if it's pretty innocent or petty they don't do anything. In China u can't accidentally drop something on the ground and not get in trouble. Or get into am argument in public that doesn't get out of hand and had a good reason to nip at a person for being terrible... hence people holding each other accountable for their actions.,0,2021-10-31T05:13:28Z,UgwNyTHgZMzwlQ_Z4Ot4AaABAg

@OCinTexile,"Huh??  I haven't watched the video, but the title's question is insane.  China is STILL, as it has been for more than 70 years, a Communist Party dictatorship and surveillance of its citizenry to ensure they comply with government diktat has, along with the constant threat of state terror against its citizens, ALWAYS been the method used to maintain the Party's stranglehold over the ""willing"" citizenry.  It should be well known to all that the people of China have no inviolable rights.  The government can and does do whatever it feels necessary to its people.  They enforce ""willingness"" and there is an absolute lack of the right to privacy.  By constant surveillance citizens of China can be arrested and held without charge, submitted to trials whose outcome against them is guaranteed, disappear into internal Chinese gulag-style labor camps or be summarily executed, and their ""property"" can be searched and/or confiscated at the whim of government officials - these have paperwork to give everything the appearance of veracity and legitimate authority, but the Party controls all aspects of government, executive, legislative and judicial.  There is no rule of law in China - the Party is the law.  Remember, the people have NO freedom of speech, religion, press, association, due process, nor right to a fair trial in any matter and never have in the past 72 years since the revolution (except for a very short period in 1989 when Party control loosened for a time before the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square restored its absolute control), and certainly do NOT have the right to not be under constant surveillance,  even in their own homes.  Saying they are willing participants is ludicrous when they have no choice.  They in fact have no positive freedoms or rights at all.  The country's government is thoroughly corrupt, dishonest and while it may lack Mao's deranged brutality, maintains the same level of control by more subtle but equally terrifying means as ever.  The only thing that's changed in China regarding surveillance is that new technology has allowed it to become much more powerful, intrusive and all-pervasive, impacting every aspect of Chinese life, very much in the way Big Brother is depicted in Orwell's 1984.  If China is the way of the future, then the future really will be a very bleak place.  All free peoples should be doing everything they can to ensure that China's pathologies do not spread beyond its borders, and, as far as is possible (not much sadly), attempt to minimize the damage caused by all-pervasive surveillance in China itself.",0,2021-10-30T13:22:59Z,Ugw9anm-A9NCkoUoLmZ4AaABAg

@eddielao7568,"You said that you were not able to verify many details of sidik's story, but you did not present other views. Your presentation is biased against China. I am Chinese and i believe most Chinese like what the government is doing. As long as you don't do anything illegal or immoral, you have no problem that the government knows where you have been, what you have done, or what you like or dislike. Instead you feel safer in the street because criminals know that they will be caught and are less likely to do anything to you publicly. I have been to Uramqi and there are checkpoints everywhere. And these checkpoints make me feel safe. If the police discover a wanted criminal, shouldn't they arrest him immediately. Covering the head of a suspect during arrest is a way to protect the suspect and is practiced by some western countries. What is wrong with that? Criticizing the government will not land you in jail because you can see people doing that over the internet. It's when you criticize the government with the intention to subvert it or create social unrest that will be penalized. China does have some censorship on sensitive political issues, but over 90 percent of the people supports the government and are satisfied with what the government is doing. That's much better than most, if not all, western countries.",0,2021-10-24T03:44:57Z,Ugw3geWeuf4yHs-ORPl4AaABAg

Now you can walk through the complex and not see or smell garbage. A plus. Also me or my wife can walk in the city, a gigantic city without fearing any violent crime, even late at night. Its not even on our mind. Overall the monitoring in my opinion has lead to a almost entire society without violent daily crime.

@zhizhouhe9077,"Literally，every type of western media is painting China the same way, it’s like a lie told 1000 times can be considered truth。kinda getting tired of it，even we Chinese got scared when watching the so call documentaries depicted/filmed in certain ways。It kinda makes us think whether we truly are living in a painful place where we cannot do or say what we want。We are all robots who need compassion from ppl holding the high moral ground，viewing us from above，like they are God taking care of those ppl living in pain （mostly Chinese ppl），even when we smile，that's forced。How sarcastic. Not every household has that kinda high-tech fridge, I don’t have that at least, not even any of my relatives as far as I know, you can get one if your are interested. Every piece of high-tech that we are seriously impressed/scared are from the films made by western world. Yet, China is painted the way that only appeared in those movies. If you are really interested in China from where you are, instead of only staying there and criticizing the place that you have never even been or even truly care about, just come and take good advantage of your eyes and ears, they are made for a reason. I mean, seriously? Literally, China bad, no freedom, no privacy, genocide. I am expecting more new accuses and crimes. We have 56 ethnic groups, why Uighur ppl are only under great surveillance¿ what about Miao ppl in my province? What about Zhuang ppl in Guangxi province¿what about 25 minority ppl living in Yunnan province¿ Are they being brutally treated like how you painted Uighur ppl in those documentaries¿Why not? Because that bloody accident done by terrorists in Kunming railway station where 29 ppl were killed in cold blood, and 143 ppl seriously injured. That’s crazy in a peaceful and safe country like China. That’s why the Chinese government started to strengthen the surveillance against those terrorists who are mainly from Xinjiang, and you know how strictly we are when fighting against an abstract Virus, and then you would understand how strictly we can be when it comes to ppl killing ppl cos that’s not a matter of medical issue, but humane issue. But that becomes genocide in western narrative so that certain western countries could stoke hate against China worldwide, with what purpose? In China we have an old saying ‘the bird flies the highest is the easy target’. I hope certain ppl have the brain to think using all kinds of information instead of every piece of information but telling the same story. A functional brian is a good thing to have for a person. That’s all politics. If Chinese are that stupid, we can’t survive for that long and not at the cost of killing innocent ppl. Think about how those revolutionaries happened. If we see suppression we fight. We don’t need other ppl who are not even living in this place to tell us that we live in hell. If you mean well, we appreciate that. If you are just behaving like fake ‘good Samaritan’, then save it.  Seeing is believing, but seeing whatever at you are provided in those media with certain purposes is not entirely believing. Love & peace.",1,2021-10-23T08:37:12Z,UgwpPFpzwyvYf5UYSGV4AaABAg

@FilipKrygsman,"The only good thing coming out of blanket surveillance is that it will never be enough. It is a self perpetuating to a point where  eventually, instead of people supporting the technology they wil begin to resist it. States will become like old feudal systems where cruelty of an increasing higher degree is the only weapon states have to counter disobedience. Once that turning point has been reached, surveillance induced freedom restrictions and punishments will increase, automatically increasing resistance as a counter movement, increasing more surveillance and violence. Look what’s happening in the Uighur regions with concentration camps and intense police coverage. Of course in the end the state will always loose, after inducing greater violence and increasing punishment as a deterrent, which is the only weapon a state has. History has a tendency to repeat itself. There is nothing new here. In the end democracy with all its flaws and imperfections is still the best system for any country. I give China 10 years at the most before collapse, which they probably will try to avoid and start a war in order to drum up patriotism, which we all know will create immense misery and a complete annihilating of China.",0,2021-10-23T01:57:00Z,Ugy2cuTNUx1b9ltnqmt4AaABAg

Don’t let China and US dominate AI if you can, can you? Douyin is not the Chinese version of Tiktok. Tiktok is born out of Douyin. DW said it this way to mislead. When they said such such is a Chinese version of such such, they want the dumbers to think China is a copycat, when in reality, it’s Silicon Valley who is stealing from Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. When the woman in the video explains how the system can help the govt to quickly get feedbacks from civilians on problems and resolve them, DW made it sound like it’s a surveillance system. Extremely dishonest. Xinjiang’s heavy surveillance was a result of Turkey sponsored Eastern Turkistan terrorist activities hacking people to deaths, including Uighurs, not because of Racial tensions. This Uighur woman in the video supposedly was persecuted, yet she can go abroad freely? Give me a break. You think we can be fed propaganda BS because you think we are stupid? This woman gets paid by the world Uighur tribunal to lie. Uighur birth rate goes down? You forgot to mention Han Chinese birth rate is even lower. When people’s living standards go up, women don’t want to be just baby bearers. Uighur population has been growing faster than the Han people. Genocide?

Through thousands years of history, the Chinese always takes the government as their utmost parent, while it gives the government absolute power, the government takes limitless responsibilities. And the Chinese really don’t care who’s governing them, as long as it can bring a good life to the most majority. So for the CPC, if it want maintain its legitimacy, it has to take good care of the Chinese people. For the surveillances, the Chinese really couldn’t care less, just like the man in the video said, they feel safe with it.

For Xinjiang, DW forgot to mention the Uighurs were stabbing, burning buses, planting bombs all the way to Beijing. There were 5000 Uighur ISIS fighters in Syria, trying to smuggle back to Xinjiang. They were heavily infiltrated by ISIS and ISIS at one point claimed XInjiang to be one of its caliphates. And lastly, this video claims that the Uighur population growth has slowed. This is coming from Chinese national bureau data to begin with. It became totally something else by the western media. The fact is, the Uighur population growth was 3-4 times faster historically compared to the other Chinese since they were never subject to the one-child policy. The population growth in recent years was slowed by a small percentage. If you look at Canada, where I live in, the population growth has been consistently slow.

Native Americans genocide by American and Canadian government is very well documented and still the program is going on in secret, it's just that the hypocritical western media never reports them. So at the end of the day USA and it's allied don't have any moral right to accuse china of commiting genocide (which are not proven yet and are most likely to be fake news), when western media and its people deliberately turn a blind eye on the millions of native Americans genocide under systematic USA and Canada government.",0,2021-10-19T12:42:04Z,UgycQc0m_EBcYWZAca94AaABAg

China they got cameras that detect people with weapons guns behavior which suggested they could be up to illegal activity. Guess the west is just not matured enough to move forward stuck in the past instead of embracing the future for everyone's prosperity.

China has 56 ethnics, why is there only 'problem' with one ethnics. because it is a created lie by western media. by the way it was orignally created by a German, and that is why DW is so keen on reporting. keep reporting, apparently Chinese people cannot get the truth if there is no help from DW. notice DW said in this report, 'they were not able to verify if it is true or not'. but without verification they claim it is truth, this is very professional.",2,2021-10-18T19:49:12Z,Ugy51X_yXpkYa8rZmxR4AaABAg

@keithwhite5657,They need surveillance cameras to watch the corrupt politicians of this world 24/7 especially where public money is spent and wasted throughout the system especially America Australia etc money bonuses and high paid jobs are a waist of time it hurts the system continuously and it's continuous funding to keep job circulation in tack wether illegal or legal . This system called democracy has created crimes on purpose bullying torture and abusing of people behind hidden doors so surveillance is welcome .

Good for the police: more jobs for them. But is not so efficiente as cameras and AI together. The tradicional police frequently get our freedon for more security and peace, they say,  but cameras are more acurate to filme some crimes with a better cost. Maybe some people don't want the use of much tecnology in this area they prefer humans because they want human doing  the same job.

When you drag your tired body to finally have a little savings, you are too old and too sick to do anything about it. 24 hours a day, sleep 10 hours, work 8 hours, eat 1 hour, prepare food, toiletries 1 hour, travel 1 hour, the rest of the time you have to improve yourself or you will lose your job, you have to take care of your children, your parents, clean your room ..... If you still have time left, all kinds of cell phone software will fill your blank, you walk on the street, sit in a restaurant, lie in bed, you will hear and see what others want to instill in you, little by little year by year, you can never hide, unless you are blind or deaf, what is freedom?

@Buckzoo2030,"Surveillance is a loaded word.  Our smartphones that monitor everything we do is also a surveillance system.  With AI and smart door bell and thermostat, tech companies also know when we are home and probably which room you are in.  In China, on top of all that, the government is  monitoring you in public space too.  In principle, the government can demand tech companies streaming them users data and still have a very good idea what are you doing milliseconds  by milliseconds.  So, what’s the fuzz? And why the Chinese government want you to know they are watching you?  Is the smartphone system we have that much better?  It’s likely a Yes because of privacy laws.   For a country that’s doesn’t have much privacy culture, privacy may not be treated  as important as laws against theft or jaywalking,  thus no laws guarding privacy?   Could this be a cultural issue?  If so, people in China may not find surveillance an intrusion but rather a protection shield for them.  It’s all our mind (brain), could it be.  Those who are raised in the west that values privacy will always find it a surveillance system, those who are raised in China may think otherwise.",0,2021-10-18T01:43:19Z,UgwUctNrn1Izr6IRx214AaABAg

In contrast, African-Americans have for the first time been able to show video evidence of previously denied instances of police brutality which has led to 'Black Lives Matter', and Julian Assange's WikiLeaks was able to use video evidence to expose US war crimes in Iraq.",1,2021-10-17T16:43:42Z,UgwBUSxF2RAN62abS0R4AaABAg

You don't have to go too many decades back in time to find that your whole society was watching you and wanting to intervene in your life. This is especially true in rural environments, all over the world. The Scandinavian Jante law is much more universal than people think. And ever since big cities became a thing, there is also the quite universal lament that while the urban environment gives you a certain freedom from the watchdogs back home, it also brings the tremendous risk of letting you drown anonymously in the crowd while nobody cares if you live or die.  I can imagine that China will be quite successful with these data and privacy laws because there is such a high level of trust in the government.",5,2021-11-17T18:05:06Z,Ugxb-W9YU4pqexXrXEF4AaABAg

@johnnyjai6804,歷來西方民族只信奉勝者為王，敗者為寇弱肉強食叢林理念，因此對「戰爭創造和平」理解也是勝者為王，敗者為寇思維。所以全世界人類有沒有東西吃，各人食物份量多少是由勝利者決定，如果聽教聽話給多一點點，聽教不聽話一點也沒有，順我者生，逆我者死。這是美國對待世界人類相處方式，完全自我為中心自私自利極權獨裁行徑。而中國人提倡「和平創造和平」理念，就是大家以和為貴要打架或吵嘴，假如存在任何矛盾和衝突都應該用和平方式解決，而且最重要大家不要砸爛大家飯碗。如果有任何吃的東西大家平均吃，只要大家努力合作是可以把蛋糕越造越大，大家蛋糕份數越分越多，吃蛋糕人越來越多，這是中國人提倡「人類命運共同體」全球人類生存理念。但美國官員說行，你們所有人只能順我者生，逆我者死，如果不聽從指示搞抹黑和制裁行動，甚至軍事唬嚇和侵略你，這就是美國民主政治騙子真面目。今天地球比喻為一艘破爛不堪木船在大海漂流著，而船底中央破了一個大洞，由於船上兩個中美船長因意見合發生嚴重矛盾，美國船長說船開去西，而中國船長說船開去東，由於兩人互相讓反方向划造成木船原地踏步。由於船中央底部破了一個大洞海水不斷涌入船艙，因此站在船中央一群人要把涌入船艙海水停潑出去才沉船。所以大家能隨便走動必須站在船中央平衡中美兩邊，如果造成一邊失平衡導致木船沉沒，現在全船人等待中美誰的持久力够才能走出沉船困局。但美國船長經常威迫利誘全船人幫忙他划船去東，如果好幸有人選擇錯誤幫忙美國抗中會導致木船隨時失平衡沉沒。所以大家想地球和人類滅亡，最佳選擇就是兩邊幫忙讓中美自行解決，這樣木船不會因失平衡沉沒，全船人類就安全,0,2021-07-16T16:30:59Z,Ugz0BCva6EK3aWyzgPx4AaABAg

@nybbleme,"Everybody watching this has to remember that China doesn't just want to be a world power politically and economically, they want to be the ONLY world power, and that's the threat of an authoritarian totalitarian communist country. And now in the US we have authoritarianism being openly embraced by a political party as we recently experienced unconstitutional lockdowns and infringement of civil liberties, which economically crippled small businesses while the large corporations that were political contributors were allowed to continue operating as essential, and we also saw Mass government censorship of ""misinformation"" regarding the virus and its origins and the effectiveness of the vaccines and the effectiveness of lockdowns which all were later revealed to be 100% true. The governments of the United States and the UK are both backing ngos which are completely controlled by the deep state of both countries in order to engage in censorship of information they don't want people to know about. The government's not allowed to censor you but the government's allowed to run an allegedly independent group which advises big tech that they need to pull posts down or be sanctioned by the government.",1,2024-04-26T18:38:25Z,UgwyIZs3zziGkghaIIV4AaABAg

@TheEmpire822,"I mean I’m not usually the kind to say fighting fire with fire works. But I really do think this is one of those situations. They should be shown that they are not untouchable. Not sure what you could “legally” do to show them you’re not playing games. But possibly doxxing the people doing the hacking, hack the companies suspected of using the stolen data. And truthfully I feel at this point get into systems they don’t think you could. Don’t show all the vulnerabilities they have, but show one that’s serious, maybe cause a power grid shutdown, I know what the US did in Iran with the centrifuges that were meant to enrich uranium so these kinds of things are not out of reach of people. I mean they created software that would infect itself into computers in a specific region they knew these facilities were in, and look for something only these uranium enrichment places would have and then comprise the controls of the equipment without them ever knowing. To me, even tho it was figured out, should show what people can do, and I think sometimes you need to show a little bit of that to make people think twice. I mean if you “showed” china that you had compromised a system they never thought you could, or caused massive disruptions in their country, they would at least rethink their plans. Like I said this is about the only time I’ll agree you have to fight fire with fire. Cause you’re never going to get them into an American court room so that’s all just semantics at that point and dosent scare these people one bit.",0,2024-03-20T00:51:38Z,UgwvgtI0S2avZ6C66qt4AaABAg

@virtualyme7659,You know there was a time before the internet. Like for most of my life there was no internet. Governments companies or people couldn't hack in and take your stuff. If you don't want to get hacked don't put it on the internet. Does that sound like a drag well of course it does because the internet's pretty damn cool but on the other hand you have to weigh what's at stake and what you're putting on there and the consequences. I don't know if it's feasible but perhaps cutting China entirely off from our internet might be one way to start. Otherwise it's time to go back to keeping information the old fashioned way. Part of the problem with that is that our businesses are so intertwined now and big corporations are sucking on the Chinese tit. It's time we start punishing people who do business in China by making it so cost prohibitive no one will want to do it. I try my best not to buy anything Chinese which is a real headache because of how much we have sold ourselves out to them. We don't hardly make anything anymore. I suppose the upside to that is we don't have the horrific pollution that comes with all that manufacturing. I guess it comes down to what your average American is willing to put up with and willing to give up. Everything has a trade-off. Personally I'm willing and actively trying not to ever buy anything Chinese ever again,0,2024-03-05T01:15:47Z,UgxeFQQZ3w1JPVmwFsp4AaABAg

@kayrams1792,This has nothing to do with data theft and cyber attacks. The US failed to trap China to engage in military action in Taiwan with Nancy Pelosi saga which is what Military Industrial Complex need to survive. Now they try another provocative tactic to force China into submission. China should realize restrain physical confrontation is a peaceful good policy but there is a level were you can tolerate abusive act from the US. China should not be delusional in thinking that the US will one day come to it's sense and resume diplomacy relationship. The US is going to keep on attacking China until it react. Rather be proactive than reactive. Talk is a good tool between two civil parties but the US is barbaric empire ruled by decadent people who love nothing but the destruction of humanity and the world. Just like they kept the daughter of Hauwei founder hostage and kills many presidents they still can do worse. So China should rethink their defense strategy and nation security and stop being the polite and complacent western abuse and act accordingly to safeguard their people and interest.,0,2022-09-06T08:18:11Z,UgwU8cfxOj7O07rJZ9F4AaABAg

And Taiwan already shot down China drones because there was backing from USA... There will be more strike groups sailing through Taiwan Strait....to provoke China of course. China may have other strategies to remain calm...and we hope the reunification of Taiwan to motherland be soonest. 中国平安加油",0,2022-09-06T00:39:43Z,Ugx5TSHBWZ9ybwqsh314AaABAg

@davidstone408,Firstly this relates to a law passed by the Conservate Government of 2024.  It specifically relates to ADP feature of iCloud which is an opt-in feature - if you forget your password you lose your data as not even Apple can get the data un-encrypted.  So the amount of people this affects is limited.   The UK Government still can not data mine your content they will need a court order to access anything and need to prove to a court they have reasonable grounds.

@BeIlG,"This is where it is too bad for adding Chinese companies into the global competing markets. They are making great things, starting amazing companies, raising up china and asia as a whole. HOWEVER, when the data is extracted there is ALWAYS the fear that the government will take advantage and have to answer to NO ONE. In the US, when the gov wanted a key made to look in a known criminal/terrorists phone, apple pushed back and denied them this ability. Even the US cyber security for the agreed with them to not make this backdoor as it opened more security and privacy risks. THIS is the checks and balances needed in a gov that holds user data. One that also prosecuted when data is miss used. THis is not china. They also do not play fair as they have banned NUMEROUS non-china native companies. I do not see where the playing field is fair at all. This video its self is unviewable in china where a local Chinese youtube knockoff can wreap the rewards of a lack of global market competing.

@dr.bigface8895,"I’m going to be blunt, but I’m pretty sure this type of video is literally just here to try to scare us. And I’m gonna break this whole thing down. I am not a tech expert or a coder or developer but I do know that chatGPT is closed source and deepseek is open source so comparing the threat levels of the two is completely irrelevant. Honestly, you should be more scared of ChatGPT because you can’t run that locally and you can’t host it through another service. But with deep seek, if you have the hardware to run it, then you can run it and you can fine tune it and you can do whatever you want with it. And if you can’t run it, then there’s gotta be a service that hosts it on their own server. I’m pretty sure you can get an API to use it for much cheaper than ChatGPT with fireworks and that’s an American company. I totally understand being scared to use it through the website or the official API and I am wary of that too. But other than that, it’s just a model. They’re only doing this much fear mongering about the China stuff because openAI doesn’t want to lose the top spot. But if openAI were Chinese, you guys would’ve been breaking a sweat years ago. Honestly, you should be more scared of them than you are deepSeek because they are stealing your data and you can’t use their model and prohibit it very well. I don’t mean to offend anyone, but we really need to stop looking at really good technology with the most permissive licenses and complaining about politics instead of being grateful that there is technology that is not locked behind a $200 pay wall.",1,2025-01-30T04:38:16Z,UgxS0exJUMEfLTVvrxd4AaABAg
